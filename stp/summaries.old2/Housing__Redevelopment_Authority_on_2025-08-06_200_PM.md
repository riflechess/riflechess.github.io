#### Summary
The meeting focused on discussing the 2025 budget contingencies for tenant protections and permitting staff. Chair Johnson reviewed the minutes from the previous HRA meeting and moved to approve them, which was unanimously passed.

Director Risi was absent due to a planned vacation, but her responses to memos regarding the contingencies were discussed. Commissioner Probosky expressed support for the positions earmarked for tenant protection staffing and permitting staff. Commissioner Johnson shared concerns about the response from Director Risi, stating that she found it inadequate.

The discussion centered around the need for transparency in addressing contingencies, particularly in regards to accounting and money movement. Chair Johnson mentioned that the deadline for requests was met, but some questions remain unanswered.

A resolution will be brought forward next week to address non-contingent budget amendments, including itemizing any financial changes within the housing trust fund or HRA's budget.
