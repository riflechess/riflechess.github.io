#### Summary
The Neighborhood Safety Community Council met on August 15, 2024, to discuss various safety and quality of life concerns in Saint Paul.

The meeting began with a presentation from the Saint Paul Police Department on their summer crime prevention efforts. Officers reported a decrease in violent crimes and an increase in community engagement through neighborhood policing initiatives.

A key discussion point was the proposal for additional lighting installation in high-crime areas. The proposal, which included a budget of $200,000, was met with some opposition from Councilor Noecker (corrected to Noecker), who expressed concerns about the cost and potential impact on nearby residents. After some debate, the council voted 8-1 to approve the proposal.

The council also discussed a new community outreach program aimed at addressing homelessness in Saint Paul. The program would provide resources for individuals struggling with housing insecurity, including job training, mental health services, and temporary shelter assistance. While there was broad support for the initiative, some members raised concerns about its effectiveness and potential strain on city resources.

Additionally, the council heard from a group of residents who reported concerns about recent break-ins in their neighborhood. The police department assured them that they are working to increase patrols in the area and have increased surveillance measures.

The meeting concluded with a vote to allocate $50,000 for community outreach programs, including the homeless initiative.
