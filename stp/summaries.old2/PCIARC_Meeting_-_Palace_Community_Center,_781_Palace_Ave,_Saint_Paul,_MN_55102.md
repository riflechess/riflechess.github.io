#### Summary
The meeting started with the approval of the agenda for the evening. The chair then moved on to the January minutes, which were reviewed briefly.

The first speaker discussed the status of new commissioners for the PCR, stating that there is one commissioner who is ready to be appointed, and three potential candidates are currently going through the CPA. The mayor's office was asked to consider the problem, but no update was provided.

Next, the St. Paul police department addressed concerns regarding their involvement with customs and enforcement immigration raids within the city. They clarified that they do not have the legal authority to paint individuals based on immigration status and emphasized that local law enforcement is focused on enforcing crimes in the community, not federal immigration laws.

The meeting also touched on training for new recruits, with a total of 15 graduates from the academy. The initial field training is designed to be 16 weeks long, and they will receive hands-on experience with a training officer.

In other news, the HERO Department Report mentioned that they are currently working on budget cuts and have suspended one labor standards investigator and one buyer to allocate funds for the police department. They also discussed their work share agreement with HUD and EDOC.

The meeting concluded with discussions about setting a date for the 2025 PCR annual summit, which was tentatively scheduled for May 14th or 15th. The coordinator suggested that they have a target date with backup options in case something unexpected comes up.

Finally, there were updates on community events, including the Como District Council's Blizzard Breakfast and the Empowering Progress Business Expo at the Landmark Center.
