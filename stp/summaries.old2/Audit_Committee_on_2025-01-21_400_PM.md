#### Summary
The meeting began with a midpoint update on the current audit project by Dr. Britt. The team has made progress in collecting qualitative data through interviews with stakeholders, including OFS staff, CIB committee members, applicants, and city council members. They are still working to complete interviews and analyze data. 

Dr. Britt highlighted areas of improvement in the community engagement process, communication mechanisms, and application timeline. Recommendations for future work include leveraging multiple community engagement pathways, providing clearer guidelines for applicants, and considering phased approaches to the application process.

The meeting also discussed prioritization of projects based on cost vs. return, with a focus on high-cost, high-return initiatives such as standardized maintenance processes and public safety infrastructure. 

Ms. Vang presented an update on the topic selection process for the next project, including re-issuing the audit survey to gather community input and considering new topics from city council priorities.

Council Member Master suggested examining the impact of changes made in 2018 regarding permit inspections on health and safety issues in the city. 

Other topics discussed included possible public hearing on current audit results, reevaluation of Wilder contract, and selecting a new Audit Committee member to replace Dana.

The meeting concluded with plans for future action items, including sending out the audit survey, promoting the vacancy for the new committee member, and discussing the timeline for filling the position.
