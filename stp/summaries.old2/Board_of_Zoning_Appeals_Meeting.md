#### Summary
The meeting began with the review of minutes from a previous meeting. The first order of business was the approval of variance requests for two properties.

**Case 1: 2337 Shilcomb Avenue**
The applicant proposed to construct a new driveway on the eastern side of the property to provide access to a proposed detached garage in the rear yard. Staff recommended approval, and the Board voted unanimously (5-0) to approve the request.

During discussion, it was noted that while the alley adjacent to the property is platted, it is not usable due to trees and lack of curb cuts. The property owner would like to improve the alley but cannot do so without obtaining permission from neighboring property owners. The Board acknowledged that there are trade-offs in terms of the alley's usability.

**Case 2: 1932 Berkeley Avenue**
The applicant proposed to construct a single-story addition onto the rear of an existing single-family dwelling. Staff recommended approval subject to conditions, and the Board voted unanimously (5-0) to approve the request.

During discussion, it was noted that the property has a unique circumstance due to its existing non-conforming setback. The applicant's proposal would not harm the essential character of the property, and the addition would provide more living space for the occupants.
