#### Summary
The May 2025 MACPD meeting focused on discussing several community development projects in Saint Paul. A significant portion of the discussion centered around the Rondo Community Library, which is set to undergo a major renovation.

One of the key points of discussion was the allocation of funds for the library's renovation. The proposal included allocating $1 million from the city's budget towards the project. However, there was some disagreement among the council members regarding the use of public funds. Councilor Noecker (corrected from original text) expressed concerns about the cost and suggested exploring alternative funding sources.

The meeting also touched on other community development projects, including a new community center in the Dayton's Bluff neighborhood. The proposal for the community center received generally positive feedback from council members, but some raised concerns about the potential impact on local businesses.

Regarding public safety, there was a brief discussion about recent incidents of graffiti vandalism in the city. Councilor Noecker suggested implementing stricter penalties for those found guilty of vandalism, while others argued that more should be done to address the root causes of the issue.

The meeting concluded with a vote on the funding proposal for the Rondo Community Library renovation. The final tally was 7-2 in favor of allocating $1 million from the city's budget towards the project, with Councilor Noecker and one other member voting against it.
