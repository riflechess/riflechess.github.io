#### Meeting Info
* **Type:** Housing Redevelopment Authority (HRA) meeting
* **Purpose:** To discuss the use of the Business Assistance Fund to help tenants affected by the Alliance Bank building eviction notice and to introduce a discussion on housing policy trends
* **Date/Time:** 2025-03-26, 2:00 PM

#### Summary

The HRA met to discuss two main topics. Firstly, they discussed using $70,000 from the Business Assistance Fund to help tenants affected by the Alliance Bank building eviction notice. The fund has guidelines that need to be waived in order for this use of funds to be approved. The waivers would allow non-profit businesses and those with less than 10% equity to access the funding.

The second topic was an introduction to housing policy trends, presented by Charm Huang from Policy Link. She discussed development trends across the country, showing that there has been a decline in multifamily starts and a decrease in construction rates. However, she also highlighted hopeful trends such as local governments stepping into the developer role themselves and building affordable housing.

Commissioners expressed interest in further studying tenant protections and how they impact development rates. Commissioner Yang mentioned the need for long-term research specifically, while Commissioner Kim noted that rent stabilization is not a production tool but rather a protection one.

The meeting concluded with appreciation for Charm's presentation and a discussion about future studies on enforcement mechanisms and tools to strengthen partnerships outside of the city.
