#### Summary

The meeting began with an update on the Reparations Commission's activities, including their work plan, budget request, and community engagement efforts. The commission has made significant progress in establishing a framework for reparations in Saint Paul, including the creation of a harm report to quantify historical and ongoing injustices.

Council Member Proproski asked about future capacity or supports that the commission may need when approached by organizations interested in donating. The commission's chair, Traherne Cruz, responded that they are still navigating this process but hope to have infrastructure in place soon.

The meeting then shifted to an update on the opioid crisis response from St. Paul Ramsey County Public Health. Director Amy Kieran and Deputy Director Ray Eden Frank presented data showing a decrease in overdose deaths in Minnesota, including in Ramsey County. However, disparities persist among different racial groups, with African Americans and American Indians experiencing higher rates of overdose death.

The county has received $26 million in opioid settlement funds and is using them to support community organizations and initiatives. The presentation highlighted various projects and programs funded by the settlement, including naloxone distribution, syringe exchange services, and harm reduction education. However, Council Member Bowie expressed concern that more investment was needed in prevention efforts.

Council Member Povatsky asked about the timing of disbursements from the opioid settlement funds, and Director Kieran explained that they are received in staggered amounts, with some already spent on naloxone distribution and community grants. The county is currently staffing up its program and releasing an RFP for strategic planning.

The meeting concluded with a presentation from Assistant Chief Steve Sampson of the St. Paul Fire Department, who discussed their efforts to address the opioid crisis through the use of Narcan and Suboxone. They have administered three doses of Suboxone so far but plan to expand this effort by deploying it on ambulances in high-use areas.
