#### Summary
The Neighborhood Safety Community Council held a special session on June 12, 2024, to address public safety concerns and quality of life issues in the city. The meeting was attended by council members, city officials, and community representatives.

The council discussed several key topics:

* **Budget Allocation for Public Safety:** The council voted to allocate an additional $200,000 from the city's budget to support community policing initiatives and crime prevention programs.
* **Community Engagement:** Council members emphasized the importance of engaging with local residents and business owners to address public safety concerns. They proposed establishing a community outreach program to facilitate regular meetings between law enforcement officials and neighborhood representatives.
* **Homeless Shelter Relocation:** The council debated the relocation of a homeless shelter in the city's downtown area. Some council members expressed concerns about potential safety risks associated with the shelter, while others argued that it would provide essential services to vulnerable individuals.

**Contestation:**
The vote on budget allocation for public safety was unanimous. However, the discussion on homeless shelter relocation sparked some tension among council members. Councilor **Nacre** (corrected to Noecker) expressed concerns about the potential impact of the shelter on surrounding businesses and residents, while others argued that it would be beneficial for the community.

A vote is scheduled for the next meeting to finalize the decision on the homeless shelter relocation. The council will continue to discuss and refine their proposals in future meetings.
