#### Summary

The CIB Committee met to review and discuss community investment budget allocations for the upcoming fiscal year. The committee considered proposals from various city departments and organizations.

Key decisions:

* **Community Development Block Grants (CDBG):** The committee allocated $1 million to support neighborhood revitalization efforts in Frogtown, including funding for affordable housing and small business development.
* **Youth Programs:** The committee approved $500,000 for youth programming initiatives, focusing on after-school activities, mentorship, and job training.
* **Public Safety:** The committee discussed potential allocations for public safety initiatives, including support for the Saint Paul Police Department's Community Engagement Program.

A contentious discussion arose regarding funding for the Lowertown area. Some committee members expressed concerns that the proposed allocation of $750,000 was not sufficient to address the area's unique needs and challenges. Others argued that the funds would be better spent on more pressing community development projects elsewhere in the city. After a 10-5 vote, the proposal was approved with the condition that the Lowertown area receive additional funding consideration for future budget cycles.

The committee also discussed potential partnerships with local non-profits to support community programming and services.
