* **Meeting Type**: CIB (Community Information Bureau) Committee Meeting
* **Purpose**: Discuss various community initiatives, public safety concerns, and policy updates
* **Date/Time**: Wednesday, March 15, 2023 at 6:00 PM
* **Location**: Saint Paul City Hall, Room 300

#### Summary
The CIB Committee meeting covered several key topics:

* The committee discussed the new community policing initiative, which aims to increase police visibility in neighborhoods and improve relationships between law enforcement and the community.
* The city's budget for public safety initiatives was also reviewed, with a focus on allocating funds for additional community outreach programs.
* A proposal to establish a neighborhood watch program in the Summit-University district was presented. While some committee members expressed concerns about potential resistance from local residents, others saw it as an opportunity to enhance community engagement and reduce crime.

A contentious point of discussion arose when committee member Rachel Johnson questioned the effectiveness of increased police presence without addressing underlying social issues, such as poverty and lack of access to education and job opportunities. This sparked a debate among committee members, with some arguing that public safety should be prioritized above other concerns, while others emphasized the need for a more comprehensive approach to community development.

The proposal to establish the neighborhood watch program was ultimately approved by a vote of 6-2, with Johnson and another committee member dissenting.
