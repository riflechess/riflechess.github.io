#### Summary
The city council meeting began with a presentation by Assistant Mayor Nick Stummelanger on the city's 2026 legislative agenda. He outlined several key priorities, including the arena complex and surrounding entertainment district, making sure individuals and families affected by immigration surge get reimbursed for costs incurred, establishing a reimbursement program for law enforcement agencies that respond to protests and demonstrations at the Capitol complex and governor's residence, state and regional investments into the West Seventh corridor, reinstating funding for regional parks, and repealing some of the local government preemption on common sense gun violence prevention measures.

The council then discussed resolution 26-132, celebrating 140 years of the St. Paul Winter Carnival. The resolution was adopted unanimously.

Next, the council moved to consider several public hearings related to zoning regulations, financing and spending plans for various city departments, and a donation from Unity Church Unitarian to support the St. Paul Recovery Act Community Reparations Commission. The council voted to approve each of these items.

The council also considered item 19, which was a public hearing on grievances about federal immigration operations. Several speakers testified, expressing concerns about the impact of federal immigration enforcement activities on the city's residents and businesses. They requested clear public clarification on the city separation ordinance, oversight and response to reports of misconduct by federal officials, protection for vulnerable community spaces, and greater clarity and communication from the city leaders.

In other business, the council approved an amended resolution extending until February 20th the completion of abatement at a property located at 1079 Western Avenue North. The legislative hearing consent agenda items were also adopted as amended.

The meeting concluded with announcements of various events and resources available to residents, including a Know Your Rights training event, Rondo Night at the Winter Carnival, and public comment sessions regarding the Rethinking I-94 project.

Overall, the meeting focused on several key issues, including the city's legislative agenda, zoning regulations, public safety, and community concerns related to federal immigration enforcement activities.
