#### Summary
The meeting began with a ceremonial reappointment of Chief Butch Inks as the Chief of Fire Department. The council members expressed their appreciation for his leadership and service to the city.

Next, the council discussed Resolution 25-1145, which pertains to sewer revenue bonds series 2025C. The resolution was approved with some amendments.

The council also considered a staff report from Bryn House, the Intergovernmental Relations Director, on the 2025 Legislative Session Report. She presented an overview of the challenges faced during the session, including budget pressures and unexpected member vacancies. Despite these difficulties, some key priorities were successful, such as the $700 million GEO bonding bill.

The council then moved to discuss various ordinances and resolutions related to zoning, licensing, and public hearings. These included a proposal for a commercial development district expansion at the Energy Park site, a rezoning application for the Hams Brewery site, and several other items.

During the discussion on the Hams Brewery rezoning, many speakers testified, both in favor of and against the proposal. The council ultimately approved a motion of intent to approve the rezoning request.

The meeting concluded with a public hearing on an appeal related to a zoning variance for Stronger Sober House at 519 Farrington Street. The council voted to lay over this item to August 6th, allowing for further study and examination.
