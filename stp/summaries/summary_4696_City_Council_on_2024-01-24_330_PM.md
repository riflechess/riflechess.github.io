#### Summary
The meeting began with a consent agenda that was adopted without discussion. The council then heard a presentation from Director Kershaw of Public Works on snow plowing operations. He explained the team's efforts to keep streets safe during winter weather events, including communication with residents and coordination with other departments. Council members asked questions about the process for declaring snow emergencies, improving residential street service levels, and partnering with community organizations.

The council also honored Peter Warner, an assistant city attorney who is retiring after 36 years of service. His colleagues praised his dedication to the city and his willingness to provide guidance on complex issues. The resolution recognizing his career was adopted unanimously.

Next, the council heard a public hearing for rezoning properties at 0 St. Clair Avenue and 736 Oakdale Avenue. Some residents expressed concerns about traffic and parking in these areas, but ultimately supported the zoning changes.

The meeting also included discussion of vacant building fees, with a representative from a property owner group asking for leniency on payment terms due to financial difficulties. The council ultimately decided to lay over this issue for two weeks to allow further consideration and clarification.

Finally, the council heard news from the wards, including an invitation to attend the funeral service for Tujer Zhang, a community leader who was tragically murdered in Colombia.
