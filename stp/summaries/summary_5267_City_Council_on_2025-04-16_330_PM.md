#### Summary

The meeting began with a brief discussion on labor relations, followed by the approval of Resolution 25-630 recognizing the Hmong National Development Conference. The council then moved to discuss various resolutions and ordinances related to zoning, land use, and public safety. A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to debating and voting on the sound level variance for Breakaway Music Festival. The festival organizers proposed a variance of 103 decibels at 125 feet, which was initially met with resistance from some council members due to concerns about noise pollution.

However, after negotiations between DSI staff and the event organizers, a compromise was reached, and the council voted to approve version two of the resolution, which included conditions such as staff presence during the event and sound monitoring equipment. The public hearing on this item was reopened, and the council members heard from the event organizer, who presented a revised plan for reducing noise levels.

The council also discussed and voted on various other items, including ratification of special tax assessments, zoning changes, and approval of grant funds. Some council members expressed concerns about the lack of communication between departments and the need for more transparency in the decision-making process.
