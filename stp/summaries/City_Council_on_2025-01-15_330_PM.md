**Public Hearing on Ordinance 25-2**

- The meeting began with Council President Jalali explaining that this was a public hearing for the ordinance.
- Testimony was heard from multiple community members in support of administrative citations as a tool to hold landlords and employers accountable for violating city ordinances, particularly those affecting workers' rights and rent stabilization.

**Consent Agenda Items**

- Council Member Yang moved to close the public hearing on item number 25 (Ordinance 25-2) after no further testimony was given.
- The council then voted in favor of closing the public hearing.
- Consent agenda items 29 through 54 were also discussed, with staff recommending taking items separately for consideration.

**Other Items**

- The city received a grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation and will use it to execute a cooperative agreement.
- A motion was made to close the public hearings on consent agenda items 29 to 54, which passed without opposition.

**Notable Decisions**

- Council Member Johnson suggested laying over item number 39 (RLH RSA 24-12) for one week to further review a rent increase appeal.
- The council decided to lay over item 47, a special tax assessment, and discussed possible reductions in the assessment amount due to a misunderstanding by the homeowner about what was required.
