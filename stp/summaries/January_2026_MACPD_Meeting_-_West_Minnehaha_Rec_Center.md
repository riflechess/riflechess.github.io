* **Location:** West Minnehaha Rec Center

#### Summary

The MACPD meeting was attended by local law enforcement representatives, city officials, and concerned citizens. The main topics discussed included:

* **Crime Update:** There was a brief overview of recent crime statistics in the Midway neighborhood, with an emphasis on property crimes.
* **Community Engagement:** Discussion centered around ways to increase community involvement in crime prevention efforts, including organizing block parties and improving communication between residents and law enforcement.
* **Budget Allocations:** A proposal to allocate $10,000 for additional lighting installations along Minnehaha Avenue was approved unanimously.

A contentious point of discussion arose when some attendees expressed concerns about the effectiveness of current crime prevention strategies. One resident suggested re-evaluating the city's priorities and focusing on addressing root causes of crime rather than just treating symptoms. However, this idea did not gain significant traction among attendees.

In a separate matter, a local business owner raised concerns about recent break-ins in the area and requested increased police presence during evening hours. The MACPD representatives assured the attendee that they would work with the Saint Paul Police Department to address these concerns.

The meeting concluded with a general consensus on the importance of community engagement and continued collaboration between residents, law enforcement, and city officials to maintain public safety and quality of life in the Midway neighborhood.
