#### Summary
The meeting began with updates from city officials on ongoing projects in the neighborhood. Key points include:

* A new community garden is planned for the vacant lot on Como Avenue.

* Residents brought up concerns about crime and safety, specifically around the recent break-ins along Como Avenue.

There was some discussion and disagreement among residents regarding the proposed community garden. Some were excited about the potential for more green space, while others expressed concerns about maintenance costs and potential noise pollution. No formal decision was made on the issue.

A vote to allocate funds for streetlight repairs was unanimous among HREEOC members. The city will provide matching funds to upgrade lighting along Como Avenue.

Residents also discussed plans for a neighborhood clean-up event in March, with a focus on beautifying Raymond Avenue and surrounding streets.
