#### Summary

The meeting began with a resolution recognizing June as Black Music Month in St. Paul, which was introduced by Ms. Bowie. The resolution honored several local black artists and organizations for their contributions to the community. Many of the artists spoke about how music has helped them heal, express themselves, and bring people together.

Next, the council voted on resolutions approving the mayor's appointments to various boards, including the Board of Water Commissioners and the St. Paul Port Authority Board. Council Member Yang expressed her gratitude for the support and announced that she would be taking maternity leave starting in June.

The main topic of discussion was a proposal for a commercial development district at 1624-1626 White Bear Avenue North. Dan Nigelic, Deputy Director of the Department of Safety and Inspections, explained that commercial development districts allow for more flexible liquor licensing regulations, which can help attract businesses to certain areas. The council asked several questions and requested additional information on how this proposal would benefit the community.

A public hearing was held on a sound level variance request from the Hmong International Freedom Festival organizers. Several speakers testified in support of the festival and thanked the council for their support. Council Members Bowie and Johnson spoke about the importance of this event to the Hmong community and expressed their excitement for its continued success.

The council also approved several other resolutions, including one authorizing an increase in grant funding for the BIPOC Parks Ambassadors program and another accepting a $120,000 grant from the Ford Foundation to support budget engagement sessions. A resolution amending the financing and spending plans for the Fire Department was also approved.

At the end of the meeting, Council Members Bowie and Johnson shared some good news, including an upcoming concert series in Mears Park called Lower Town Sounds, which will take place every Thursday night through the summer. They also mentioned a job fair at the IBEW office in Ward 7 and the opening of the B-Line bus rapid transit along Marshall and Selby.
