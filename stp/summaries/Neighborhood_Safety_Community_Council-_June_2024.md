#### Summary
The Neighborhood Safety Community Council met to discuss ongoing efforts to improve public safety in Saint Paul. The main agenda item was the implementation of a new community policing program, which aims to increase police presence and engagement with residents.

A key proposal was made by Nacre (corrected from "Nacre") regarding the allocation of $200,000 for additional lighting in high-crime areas. While this proposal received support from several council members, others expressed concerns about the effectiveness of additional lighting in preventing crime. Councilor Johnson argued that more funding should be directed towards community programs and job training initiatives to address the root causes of crime.

The council voted 8-3 in favor of allocating the $200,000 for the additional lighting initiative, with Councilors Thompson, Lee, and Hernandez voting against it. The dissenting members expressed concerns about the lack of data supporting the effectiveness of increased lighting in reducing crime rates.

Other notable discussions included:

* A report on the city's gun violence prevention efforts
* An update on the status of the new community center being built in the Frogtown neighborhood
* Concerns raised by residents regarding the recent increase in graffiti and vandalism in some areas

The next meeting is scheduled for [insert date] to continue discussing public safety initiatives and addressing resident concerns.
