**Date/Time:** November 5, 2025, 2:00 PM
**Purpose:** To discuss and vote on various items related to affordable housing development in Saint Paul.

#### Summary

The meeting began with the approval of previous meeting minutes. The main agenda item was the discussion and vote on Resolution 25-1706, which endorses amendments to the Minneapolis-St. Paul Housing Finance Board's 2026-2027 qualified allocation plan citywide. Commissioner Johnson expressed concerns about reducing the affordability period from 30 years to 15 years, citing it as "regressive" and not in line with the city's commitment to long-term affordability.

Commissioner Noecker spoke in favor of the motion, addressing several points made by opponents. He emphasized that this was a limited-time proposal for downtown projects only and would increase affordable housing capacity without using city dollars. Commissioner Yang also supported the motion, citing the need to address financial constraints on residents and the potential for development if not done through public subsidies.

The commission voted in favor of Resolution 25-1706, with five commissioners voting "aye" and two opposing (Chair Johnson and Commissioner Kim).

The meeting also included a discussion and vote on Resolution 25-1709, which authorized the release of the 4-D Affordable Housing Incentive Program Covenant on 1048 Central Avenue West. The commission approved this resolution without any opposition.

Finally, the meeting featured a staff report from Libby Logsdon regarding a Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) loan extension request for Ramsey Hill Apartments. Melinda Studer from Trellis Co. also provided additional information and context about the project. Commissioner Bowie expressed support for the item but requested clarification on some details.

The meeting concluded with no other items on the agenda, and the commission adjourned.
