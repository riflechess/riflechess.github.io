#### Summary

The meeting began with a brief discussion of some minor issues before moving on to the main agenda items. The first item was the approval of the May 2025 HRA meeting minutes, which was approved unanimously. Next, the board discussed Resolution RES 25-868, approving the nomination of Commissioner Nacre to the Minneapolis-St. Paul Housing Finance Board. This resolution was also approved unanimously.

The third item on the agenda was Resolution RES 25-869, which involves reserving funds for certain St. Paul projects applying for funding from the Minneapolis Housing Finance Agency. This resolution was approved with a unanimous vote as well.

The main presentation of the meeting was given by Director Newton and Senior City Planner Spencer Miller-Johnson regarding the T-District Zoning Update. The proposal aims to update the zoning standards in the city's Traditional Neighborhood districts (T-Districts) to better reflect modern development practices and the city's 2040 comprehensive plan.

The proposed changes include clarifying the purpose and intent of each T district, increasing development flexibility at nodes and along corridors, incentivizing affordable housing through a density bonus program, streamlining design standards, and modernizing code language. Commissioner Provatsky expressed support for the proposal but suggested that minimum building height requirements be established in some districts.

Commissioner Yang also voiced her support for the proposed changes and asked about sidewalk improvements in T-Districts. Director Newton explained that while there are no proposed changes to sidewalk dimensions, the zoning study aims to promote pedestrian-friendly development with mixed land uses close to the street.

The meeting concluded with a discussion of the economic development strategy draft and a request from Commissioner Bui for an update on its status. The Deputy Mayor will be presenting on downtown revitalization on June 25th, and Commissioners were asked to submit any questions or topics they would like covered in advance.

Overall, the meeting focused primarily on zoning updates and economic development initiatives in the city.
