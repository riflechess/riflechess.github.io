#### Summary
The HRA meeting discussed the reservation of funding for six projects that will be applying to the MHFA grant program. The projects are:

1. Hams East End Apartments: a new construction of 110 affordable units with a total development cost of approximately $48 million.
2. Gloryville: a mixed-use project with 87 affordable units and 23,000 square feet of commercial space, including a grocery store, with a total development cost of approximately $50 million.
3. Face-to-Face: a four-story mixed-use project with 24 deeply affordable housing units and 6,000 square feet of office for face-to-face services, with a total development cost of approximately $13 million.
4. Torrey de San Miguel: an existing project on the west side consisting of 142 two-, three-, and four-bedroom townhome units, with a comprehensive rehab estimated at about $60 million.
5. Aragon by Beacon: a new 53-unit workforce building serving households at 30% and 50% of AMI, with approximately 25% of those units being three- and four-bedrooms.
6. Ramsey Hill Project: owned by Trellis, consisting of 54 units, serving households at 30% and 50% of area median income in six buildings.

The HRA will be providing a reservation of funding for these projects, which is not a binding or enforceable legal agreement but rather a commitment to hold funds in the event that a project receives funding through this year's RFP. The next meeting will discuss approval of the resolution for action.

In other business, Director Newton presented on the HRA Parking Enterprise Fund, discussing its revenue and expenses, as well as its reserves. Commissioner Noecker asked about prioritizing the use of excess funds in the parking fund, and Director Newton explained that historically, any surplus has been rolled into reserves. The meeting concluded with a discussion on the neighborhood parking program, which has not been used extensively due to decreased revenues.

There were no contentious votes or disagreements during this meeting.
