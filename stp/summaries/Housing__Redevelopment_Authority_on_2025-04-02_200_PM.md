#### Summary

The Housing Redevelopment Authority discussed two new programs: Healthy Homes and Power of Home. The goal of these programs is to improve the energy efficiency of homes for low-income residents in St. Paul. The Healthy Homes program focuses on pre-weatherization and weatherization, while the Power of Home program aims to upgrade equipment and appliances.

The meeting covered various topics, including:

* A presentation by Danielle Sindelar, Project Manager, explaining the programs' goals and how they will work.
* Discussion about the partnership with Chief Resilience Officer Russ Stark and Kurt Schultz from the team working on these initiatives.
* Commissioner Yang's question about window replacement resources, which was answered by Director Newton and Chair Johnson.
* A discussion about prioritization of projects and how to ensure that funds go back to impacting those families who are most energy burdened.
* Commissioner Necker's concern about rewarding landlords for not fixing certain issues with public dollars.
* The intention to have a combined application form for both programs and the goal of making it easy for people to apply.

Some key decisions made during the meeting include:

* The Healthy Homes program will focus on pre-weatherization and weatherization, while the Power of Home program will upgrade equipment and appliances.
* Both programs are designed as grants, with no repayment required.
* The income qualification is lower at 50% area median income for the Power of Home program.

The meeting also highlighted some potential challenges and considerations, such as:

* Ensuring that funds go back to impacting those families who are most energy burdened.
* Prioritizing projects and ensuring that they meet specific criteria.
* Making sure that contractors have the capacity to do the work required by these programs.
