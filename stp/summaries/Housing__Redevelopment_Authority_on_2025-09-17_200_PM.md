#### Meeting Info
Meeting: Housing and Redevelopment Authority (HRA)
Date/Time: 2025-09-17 at 2:00 PM
Purpose: Discussion of Conduit Revenue Bonds for Metro Deaf School Project, Sale and Conveyance of Property to Dayton's Bluff Neighborhood Housing Services, and 2026 HRA Budget 2.0.

#### Summary

The meeting began with a presentation from Jenny Wolfe on the introduction of Conduit Revenue Bonds for the Metro Deaf School Project. The bonds would be used to refinance existing debt and finance a new addition to the school building. The project is expected to add classrooms, a gymnasium, and improve accessibility.

Next, Sarah Zorn presented the sale and conveyance of property to Dayton's Bluff Neighborhood Housing Services, which has been working on redevelopment efforts in the neighborhood for decades. The site was previously used as a street-sweeping dump but has since been cleaned up with funding from HUD and other sources. The project aims to build 21 more single-family homes in the area.

The final item on the agenda was the 2026 HRA Budget 2.0, which includes several updates and clarifications to previous budget discussions. Deputy Director Green presented a follow-up presentation after receiving feedback from commissioners. Some key points include:

* The office-to-housing fee waiver program has not spent any of its allocated funds for 2025, but it's expected that the $1 million will roll over into next year.
* The power of home program is expected to launch next month and will utilize the 2025 funding before the end of this year.
* Commissioner Maker raised questions about the office-to-housing conversion program, which was not clearly explained in the PowerPoint presentation. Director Weezy may be invited to provide further explanation.
* Commissioner Bowie expressed interest in hearing more about the office-to-housing piece and how it relates to state statutes and housing trust fund flexibility.

The meeting also discussed other budget items, including down payment assistance, emergency rent assistance, Catholic Charities response funding, and business assistance funds. Some commissioners requested more information on specific programs and budgets.

Overall, the meeting focused on clarifying budget details, discussing potential investments in downtown development, and exploring ways to improve the office-to-housing fee waiver program.
