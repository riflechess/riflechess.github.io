The meeting began with a roll call of council members and a brief discussion about the order of business. The consent agenda was adopted as amended, with Item 16 being taken separately.

Council Vice President Kim presented the staff report for Resolution 25-1242, which would place a moratorium on applications for zoning controls for sober houses and supportive housing facilities. This resolution is a bridge measure to allow the Planning Commission to conduct a study on how to best regulate these types of facilities. The council voted unanimously to adopt this resolution.

Next, the council celebrated the 50th anniversary of the district council system with an honorary resolution sponsored by Council Member Jost. Several district council executive directors and board members spoke about their experiences working in the district councils and expressed gratitude for the recognition. The council voted unanimously to adopt the resolution.

Ryan Perez from COPAL Minnesota and Stephen Seidel from Indivisible Twin Cities spoke in support of the resolution, highlighting the impact of these policies on immigrant communities. The council voted unanimously to adopt this resolution.

The meeting then moved on to a series of public hearings and legislative hearing items. Council Member Provatsky presented an item regarding an appeal of a summary abatement order for tall grass and weeds at 1345 Kent Street. Adam Dellinger, the owner of the property, spoke about his concerns with the process and requested that the council change or modify the ordinance to allow for native landscapes over eight inches.

Council Member Yang moved to approve the appeal, citing the importance of allowing native plantings for pollinators. The motion was approved unanimously by the council.

The meeting concluded with a series of public hearings and legislative hearing items being laid over until future meetings.
