#### Summary

The City Council meeting began with a brief introduction and roll call. The first item on the agenda was Resolution 25-1242, which aimed to establish a moratorium on applications for zoning controls for sober houses and supportive housing facilities. The resolution was moved by Council Member Povaraski and seconded by Council Vice President Kim. After discussion, the resolution was adopted with unanimous approval.

The meeting then shifted to Item 18, Resolution 25-1200, which celebrated the 50th anniversary of the St. Paul District Council system. Various council members and district council representatives expressed their appreciation for the recognition and highlighted the importance of community engagement in the city's development.

Item 19 was a public hearing on ABZA 25-3, considering an appeal to a decision by the Board of Zoning Appeals regarding a supportive housing facility at 418 Sherbourne Avenue. Council Member Favatsky moved to lay this item over until the completion of a study on sober and supportive housing facilities or July 22nd, 2026, whichever comes first.

The meeting also included public hearings on various items related to sound-level variances for events in parks and other locations throughout the city. Some council members expressed concern about the potential impact of these events on residents and asked that the events be held at quieter times or with more consideration for nearby noise levels.

Additionally, Council Member Johnson mentioned a constituent who came to testify on Item 22, final adoption of Ordinance 25-41, amending Chapter 33.04 of the Legislative Code to require 10% of the estimated plan review fee to be paid before a review may begin.

Council also considered several legislative hearing items, including RLHSAO 25-10 and RLHTA 25-294. In each case, council members moved to close the public hearings and approve the recommendations or resolutions put forth by the Legislative Hearing Officer.

The meeting concluded with announcements of upcoming events and activities in the city, including budget events, festivals, and training sessions for constitutional observers.
