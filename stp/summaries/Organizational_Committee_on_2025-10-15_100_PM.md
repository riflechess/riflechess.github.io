#### Summary

The meeting focused on discussing gun violence prevention policies and ordinances in Saint Paul. The committee heard presentations from various organizations, including Moms Demand Action, Protect Minnesota, and the City of Saint Paul's Inter-governmental Relations team.

Key decisions:

* The committee discussed a proposed ordinance to ban assault weapons, large capacity magazines, and binary triggers within city limits.
* The ordinance would require firearms to have a serial number and prohibit untraceable "ghost guns."
* It would also restrict firearms in sensitive places, including parks, libraries, rec centers, and city-owned buildings.
* Enforcement of the ordinance would not take place until the state preemption law is repealed.

Controversy:

* The committee debated the definition of assault weapons, with some members suggesting that a magazine capacity limit of 10 rounds would be more effective than the proposed 20 rounds.
* Councilmember Jost asked about the role of municipalities in regulating firearms and whether they have the capacity to enforce serialization requirements.
* Representative Pinto mentioned that there are bills at the state level related to ghost guns, but he couldn't speak to exactly what's in those bills.

Next Steps:

* The proposed ordinance will be presented for first reading next week (October 22nd) and public hearing on November 5th.
* The committee will continue to work with stakeholders to build a coalition across the state and advance gun violence prevention policies at the local and state level.
