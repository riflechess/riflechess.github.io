#### Summary

The City Council meeting began with a public hearing on creating the Creative Enterprise Zone Commercial Development Districts. The councilors discussed and voted on several items related to this proposal. After receiving feedback at the public hearing, the councilors decided to move forward with version 2 of the ordinance.

The consent agenda was also approved, which included authorizing expenditures for food and refreshments at the City of St. Paul Black History Month final event. Councilor Jost amended item 22 to add $500 from the City Attorney's Office to provide additional funds for the events.

A public hearing was held on Resolution Public Hearing 24-34, approving the application of DBH St. Paul LLC for a sound global variance to present amplified sound at CHS Field for the 2024 Ballpark Cooley event. The public hearing was closed, and the resolution was adopted with no opposition.

The legislative hearing consent agenda was also approved, which included an appeal by Raj Mehta to a correction notice complaint inspection that includes condemnation of his property at 220 Robert Street South. However, since Mr. Mehta did not attend the meeting, Councilor Nacre motioned to uphold the recommendation and refer the matter to the legislative hearing officer for review in three months.

#### Highlights
