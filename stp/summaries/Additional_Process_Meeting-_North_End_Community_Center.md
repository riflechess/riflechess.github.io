#### Summary

The meeting focused on discussing the renovation plans for the North End Community Center. Key points from the discussion include:

* The proposed budget for the renovations is $2 million, which includes funds for new flooring, lighting, and security systems.
* A new community garden will be added to the center, with a budget allocation of $50,000.
* Plans for expanding the youth program at the center were discussed, including hiring additional staff and increasing the number of after-school activities.

One area of contention arose during the discussion on the proposed security system. Some council members expressed concerns about the cost, citing that it may not be necessary given the current crime rates in the area. Others argued that the added security measures would provide a safer environment for community members, particularly children and seniors who frequent the center.

A vote was held to approve the renovation plans, including the security system. The motion passed with 5 votes in favor and 2 against. The dissenting council members expressed their concerns about the cost and effectiveness of the security system, but ultimately did not have enough support to override the majority's decision.
