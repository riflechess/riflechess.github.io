#### Summary

The meeting began with an introduction by the Reparations Commission Chair, outlining the purpose and goals of the commission. The main agenda item was a discussion on potential reparations proposals for the City of Saint Paul.

After some debate, the commission voted to recommend a **Reparations Task Force**, which would be responsible for developing specific recommendations for reparations to be implemented by the city. This task force will consist of community members, city officials, and experts in relevant fields.

Some commissioners expressed concern that the proposal did not go far enough in addressing systemic injustices, while others argued that it was a necessary step towards creating meaningful change. The vote on this recommendation was **7-2**, with two commissioners voting against the task force due to concerns about its scope and potential effectiveness.

Additionally, the commission discussed potential sources of funding for reparations initiatives. Some members suggested allocating funds from the city's budget, while others proposed exploring outside grants and donations.

The meeting concluded with a commitment to continue working on developing specific reparations proposals and recommendations for the City of Saint Paul.
