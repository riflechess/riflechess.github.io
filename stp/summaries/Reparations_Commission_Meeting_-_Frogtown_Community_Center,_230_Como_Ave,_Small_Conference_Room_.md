#### Summary
The Reparations Commission met to discuss proposals for reparations in the city of Saint Paul. The commission discussed several proposals, including:
* A proposal to allocate $10 million from the city's budget towards reparations initiatives
* A plan to establish a community land trust to preserve affordable housing in historically redlined neighborhoods
* Recommendations for increased funding for programs addressing police brutality and racial disparities

The commission also heard testimony from community members on the importance of reparations, including stories about the impact of historical redlining and policing practices.

One point of contention was around the proposal to allocate $10 million from the city's budget. Some commissioners expressed concerns that this amount was too small, given the scope of the issue, while others argued that it was a good starting point for further discussion. A motion to approve the proposal passed 5-2, with Commissioner Thompson and Commissioner Johnson dissenting.

The commission also discussed potential metrics for measuring the success of reparations initiatives, including job creation, housing affordability, and education outcomes.
