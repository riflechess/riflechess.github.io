* **Date/Time**: [Insert Date and Time]
* **Location**: Frogtown Community Center, 230 Como Ave, Small Conference Room

#### Summary

The Reparations Commission meeting focused on discussing potential initiatives to provide reparations to communities historically impacted by systemic racism. The commission reviewed several proposals:

* Establishing a reparations fund for homeowners in historically redlined neighborhoods
* Implementing free or reduced-cost city services (e.g., sanitation, public transportation) for low-income residents
* Creating a program to support small business development in areas with high rates of poverty and unemployment

The meeting also included a discussion on the feasibility of providing financial compensation to descendants of enslaved individuals in Saint Paul. However, there was disagreement among commissioners regarding the scope and effectiveness of such initiatives.

Commissioner Johnson expressed concerns that the proposed reparations might not adequately address the historical trauma experienced by affected communities, while Commissioner Rodriguez argued that tangible benefits like improved access to city services would have a more immediate and positive impact on quality of life.

The commission ultimately decided to table further discussion on financial compensation until they could gather more data and engage with community stakeholders. They also agreed to explore options for providing reparative justice through policy changes and community investment initiatives.

A vote was taken, but due to the contentious nature of the discussion, it did not pass unanimously. The exact voting breakdown is not available at this time.
