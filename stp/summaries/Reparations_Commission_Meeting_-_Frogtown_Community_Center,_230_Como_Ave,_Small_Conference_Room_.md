**Purpose:** To discuss proposals and actions related to reparations for past injustices in the City of Saint Paul
**Date/Time:** [Insert Date and Time]
**Location:** Frogtown Community Center, 230 Como Ave, Small Conference Room

#### Summary
The Reparations Commission meeting focused on two main topics: the proposed Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) and potential reparations initiatives for the Frogtown neighborhood.

Key decisions:

* The commission voted to move forward with a CBA that would require developers to provide 20% of new affordable housing units in the area.
* A subcommittee was formed to research and propose specific reparations initiatives, including but not limited to:
	+ Creating a community land trust
	+ Implementing job training programs for local residents
	+ Increasing funding for local schools

Contested issue: Commissioner Johnson expressed concerns that the proposed CBA would be too restrictive and discourage development in the area. This sparked a debate among commissioners about the balance between community benefits and economic growth.

Some attendees from the audience spoke about their concerns regarding the lack of representation from Frogtown residents on the commission, which led to a discussion on how to improve outreach and engagement with the affected community.
