* **Location:** Frogtown Community Center, 230 Como Ave, Small Conference Room

#### Summary
The meeting began with a brief overview of the Reparations Commission's mission to explore ways to address systemic racism and inequality in Saint Paul. The commission members then presented several proposals for reparative actions.

**Key Decisions:**

* A proposal to establish a community land trust (CLT) program, which would allow low-income residents to purchase homes at below-market prices.
	+ This initiative was met with enthusiasm from some commission members, who argued it could help address long-standing issues of gentrification and displacement in certain neighborhoods.
	+ Others expressed concerns about the feasibility and practicality of implementing such a program.

**Vote on CLT Program:**

* The proposal passed 7-2, with one member abstaining.
* Commissioner Maria Hernandez strongly opposed the measure, citing concerns that it could lead to bureaucratic red tape and inefficiencies in the city's housing policies. She also argued that more study was needed before implementing such a program.

**Other Proposals:**
The commission discussed but did not vote on several other proposals, including:
- A reparative justice program for people impacted by policing practices
- Increased funding for programs supporting community-based economic development initiatives
