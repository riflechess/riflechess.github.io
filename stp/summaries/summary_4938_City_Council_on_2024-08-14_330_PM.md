#### Summary

The meeting started with a recognition of the Right Track interns who have been participating in the city council meetings throughout the summer. The meeting then proceeded to discuss various consent agenda items, which were passed unanimously. 

One notable discussion was on Ordinance 24-15, amending Chapter 67 of the Legislative Code pertaining to the EG East Grand Avenue overlay district. Council Member Naker introduced amendments to balance pedestrian-oriented development with the street's unique character. The amendments were approved by a vote of 7-0.

A public hearing was also held for Resolution Public Hearing 24-164, ratifying the assessment for installation of a fire protection system at Grace English Evangelical Lutheran Church. This resolution was passed unanimously.

Additionally, there were several resolutions related to the Department of Emergency Management, the Department of Public Works budget, and the Fire Department's funding.

A public hearing was held on Resolution Public Hearing 24-189, approving the application of Anderson Race Management for a sound level variance in order to present amplified sound at Phelan Park. A concerned citizen, Casey Cox, spoke out against the proposal, citing past noise issues at Allianz Stadium. Council Member Bowie acknowledged the concerns and noted that the city would be monitoring the event.

The meeting also included a legislative hearing on item 59, RLH RSA 24-4, an appeal of Sumaya Mohamed's rent stabilization determination at the Haven of Battle Creek property. The hearing officer recommended dismissing the appeal due to lack of standing, but several council members expressed concerns about habitability issues and potential violations of city ordinances.

Council Member Johnson made a motion to approve the appeal, citing that the process took too long and that it was unfair to dismiss it based on the tenant's relocation. This motion was supported by Council Members Naker, Yang, Jost, Kim, Bowie, and Council President Chilali. The motion passed with a roll-call vote of 7-0.

The meeting concluded with a reminder to take a group photo for the Right Track interns before adjourning.
