#### Summary
The meeting focused on the proposed renovations to the Arlington Hills Community Center. The project's budget was discussed, with a total estimated cost of $2.4 million. The funds will be allocated from the city's capital improvement fund.

Key points:

* Renovation plans include updating the center's gym, adding new classrooms, and improving accessibility features

Some attendees expressed concerns about the project's timeline and potential disruption to community programs. One resident questioned the decision to allocate funds from the city's capital improvement fund, suggesting that it would be better to use a different source of funding.
