The council also approved a resolution establishing the membership of the Reparations Harm Study RFP Review Committee.

The council then moved on to discuss public safety measures, including a proposal to ban virtual currency kiosks in the city due to concerns over scams and predatory activity. Several residents testified against the ordinance, arguing that it would be unenforceable and lead to lawsuits.

Next, the council discussed and voted on several ordinances related to cannabis and hemp businesses, as well as regulations for temporary events during the World Juniors Hockey Championship. The council also heard from residents in support of or opposition to a proposed gun violence prevention ordinance.

The meeting concluded with public hearings on several resolutions, including ratification of assessments for mill and overlay construction projects and approval of the 2026 water fees and charges. The city's director of operations provided an update on the city's efforts to address concerns over vacant properties, including the CVS building at 499 Snelling Avenue North.

The council voted to approve a resolution ordering the removal of the CVS building within 15 days, with several residents testifying in support of the measure due to concerns over public health and safety. The meeting adjourned after a brief ceremony celebrating the retirement of Sherry Moore, who has served as city clerk for nearly four decades.
