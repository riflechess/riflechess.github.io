#### Summary

The meeting began with introductions from new Audit Committee member Molly Coleman and other members. The discussion focused on the current data practices request process in Saint Paul, specifically looking at the types of requests, timeliness, and staff time spent responding to them.

Dr. Britt presented a draft scope for the third project with Wilder Research, focusing on data practices, which included research questions, key stakeholders, and potential risks associated with the current approach. The committee discussed the need for a standard process for evaluating what constitutes a "good faith effort" in searching for requested information.

The group also discussed the importance of engaging with community members to gather ideas for future audits, including soliciting topics through surveys, district council meetings, and other outreach efforts. They reviewed a proposed schedule for the audit committee's closed meeting, which would alternate between current audits and topic selection.

Key decisions:

* The Audit Committee decided not to exclude police, fire, and emergency management departments from the scope of work, but instead suggested phasing their inclusion in subsequent audit cycles.
* The proposal to engage community members through district councils and surveys was discussed, with suggestions for improving the effectiveness of this process.
* A proposed schedule for closed meetings was presented, aiming to balance alternating between current audits and topic selection.

Areas of contention:

* There was some debate about whether police, fire, and emergency management departments should be included in the initial scope of work. Some committee members suggested phasing their inclusion or using a phased approach to study these departments.
* The need for clear communication with community members through surveys, district council meetings, and other outreach efforts was emphasized.

The meeting concluded with a plan to review draft engagement strategies, discuss potential audit topics, and schedule follow-up discussions in November.
