#### Summary

The meeting focused on discussing the scope of the next study on data practices, which will examine how the City of Saint Paul handles data requests. The committee reviewed a draft scope document, which outlines the key questions to be answered in the study, including:

* Current data practices and compliance processes
* Potential risks associated with the current approach
* Characteristics of current requests (e.g., types, scale, volume)
* Opportunities for improvement

The committee also discussed the schedule for the rest of 2025 and 2026, which includes a proposed timeline for completing the study. The committee aims to finalize the scope document by October and begin data collection in November.

In addition to discussing the data practices study, the committee briefly reviewed the proposed calendar for future meetings, which includes regular cadence meetings to discuss current audits and topic selection.

Regarding community engagement, the committee discussed strategies for soliciting topics from community members, including:

* Conducting surveys
* Meeting with district councils
* Engaging with other groups, such as St. Paul Strong or Insight St. Paul
* Identifying potential audit topics through complaints or feedback from council members and their staff

The committee agreed to take the suggestions and ideas discussed during the meeting into consideration when developing a draft plan for community engagement.

In terms of contentious issues, there was some discussion about whether to include emergency services (police, fire, and emergency management) in the scope of the data practices study. Some committee members expressed concerns about the complexity and potential risks associated with including these departments, while others argued that they are likely to be significant sources of data requests and should be included. The committee ultimately decided to leave the decision on whether to include emergency services up to the auditor, Dr. Brett.
