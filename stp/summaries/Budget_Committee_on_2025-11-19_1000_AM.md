#### Meeting Info
**Meeting Type:** Budget Committee meeting for the City of Saint Paul
**Purpose:** Review and discussion of the city's budget for 2025-2026 fiscal year
**Date/Time:** November 19, 2025, 10:00 AM
**Note:** The meeting appears to be plagued by technical difficulties or a delay in starting.

#### Summary

Unfortunately, due to the technical issues, no substantive discussion or decisions were made during the meeting. It seems that the budget committee members were unable to present their proposals and discuss them with the public as intended.

Given the lack of information presented, there are no key decisions or budget allocations to report at this time. However, it is expected that the committee will continue their work on the city's budget in future meetings.

Unfortunately, I was unable to provide any further insight into potential discussions or disagreements due to the absence of meaningful content during the meeting.
