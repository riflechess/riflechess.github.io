#### Summary

The Housing Redevelopment Authority (HRA) meeting covered two main topics: the Saint Joseph's Point project and the Ramsey County Familiar Families update.

**Saint Joseph's Point Project**

* The project involves rehabilitating a 90-unit affordable housing building at 200 Wilkins Street.
* The developer, Shaffer Richardson, is requesting city assistance with recapitalization and rehabilitation to address deferred maintenance issues.
* The proposed plan includes a new roof, sealant replacements, window replacements, exterior brick repairs, HVAC replacement, water heater replacements, elevator replacements, and various mechanical, plumbing, and electrical work.
* The project will maintain affordability until 2066, with 15 units reserved for project-based vouchers at 30% of Area Median Income (AMI).
* The city is considering a $13 million bond to finance the project.

**Ramsey County Familiar Families Update**

* The update presented by John McCoy from Ramsey County's Housing Stability Department discussed the Familiar Families pilot program.
* The program aims to support five families at a time with complex needs, providing them with shelter and wrap-around services for four months before transitioning them to permanent supportive housing.
* The city of Saint Paul has reallocated $500,000 from its housing trust fund to support this project, with an additional $250,000 pledged by the St. Paul and Minnesota Foundation.
* However, the program is currently hung up in procurement due to competing priorities.

The meeting also included discussions on:

* The need for more family shelter and supportive housing units in Saint Paul.
* The importance of addressing homelessness, particularly among families with complex needs.
* The city's role in supporting homeless families and its commitment to investing in programs that address homelessness.
