#### Summary

The meeting began with the approval of the consent agenda, which included items such as the appointment of Laura Logsdon as interim director of the Office of Financial Services. The council then moved on to discuss a resolution regarding the renaming of Bruce Bento Nature Sanctuary and Indian Mounds Regional Park. This involved a staff report by Ellen Stewart, who presented the history and cultural significance of the sites to be renamed. The council voted to approve the resolution, which will rename the sites "Imanesia Scott Cultural Landscape," "Wechahapi," and "Wakantipi."

The council also discussed a zoning ordinance (Ordinance 25-32) that rezones property at 959 Payne Avenue from B2 Community Business to T2 Traditional Neighborhood. The motion was made by Council Member Yang, who expressed support for the staff recommendations.

A public hearing was held on Resolution Public Hearing 25-94, which approved an application for a sound-level variance by Shine in the World Ministries for the Merge Twin Cities events. The council voted to close the public hearing and approve the resolution.

The council also discussed several other resolutions, including one regarding the amendment of the financing and spending plan in the Department of Parks and Recreation (Resolution Public Hearing 25-90).

A contentious item on the agenda was APC 25-5, which considered the appeal of the West 7th Fort Road Federation to a decision by the Planning Commission approving a site plan for a public works yard or maintenance facility. The council heard testimony from representatives of the federation and FCC Environmental Services, as well as community members who expressed concerns about traffic patterns, air quality, water quality, and noise pollution.

The council ultimately voted to deny the appeal, with six in favor and none opposed.
