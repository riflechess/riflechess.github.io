#### Meeting Info
**Meeting Type:** City Council Meeting
**Date/Time:** May 14, 2025
**Purpose:** Discussion and voting on various resolutions, including a sound level variance for the Breakaway Music Festival, a grant for the Police Department's bomb squad, and amendments to the tax increment financing plan for the Ford Site Redevelopment Tax Increment Financing District.

#### Summary

The meeting began with a presentation from the organizers of the Breakaway Music Festival regarding their request for a sound level variance. They presented evidence that they had made significant changes to mitigate noise concerns, including relocating the main stage and adjusting sound levels throughout the day. However, Council Member Johnson expressed concerns about the proposed sound level being higher than previous festivals and questioned whether it was necessary.

After some discussion, the council voted on the resolution, with five members in favor (Kim, Bowie, Jost, Provatsky, and Yang) and two opposed (Johnson and Noecker). The resolution passed with the amendment to reduce the sound level variance from 103 decibels at 125 feet to 100 decibels at 100 feet.

The meeting also included presentations from the Police Department regarding a grant for a boat to aid in underwater explosive device mitigation. Council Member Johnson asked about potential federal ties or concerns, and Deputy Chief Ford assured her that the funding was state-based with no federal involvement.

The council then moved on to discuss a resolution authorizing the acceptance of $20,250 in grant funding from the St. Paul and Minnesota Foundation for direct guaranteed income payments to St. Paul families in the college-bound boost program. This resolution passed without opposition.

A public hearing was held regarding a tax increment financing plan amendment for the Ford Site Redevelopment Tax Increment Financing District. Council Member Yang raised concerns about the affordability levels of housing units on the site, and representatives from Ryan Companies and Widener Apartment Homes testified to address her questions.

After some discussion, the council voted on the resolution, with five members in favor (Bowie, Jost, Provatsky, Kim, and Noecker) and two opposed (Yang and Johnson). The resolution passed.

The meeting concluded with a presentation from Legislative Hearing Officer Marsha Mormont regarding proposed legislative hearing agenda items. She recommended decreasing the vacant building assessment for property at 736 Oakdale Avenue, which was in accordance with her original recommendation to halve the fee due to DSI's error in losing the application. The council voted to approve this resolution.

The meeting also included a roll call vote on the ratification of assessments, including one for property at 2054 Laurel Avenue, and discussion of various other resolutions and agenda items.
