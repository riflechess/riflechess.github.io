#### Summary

The meeting began with a moment of silence for the person killed by ICE in Minneapolis. The consent agenda items 3-24 were approved, including item 24 which was reconsidered. Resolution 26-50 declaring Saturday, January 10, 2026 as Dr. Fuwa Zhang Day in the city of St. Paul was adopted.

The meeting then moved on to item number 25 where Ms. Gao was sworn in as the new City Attorney. She expressed her commitment to partnership and collaboration with the council.

Next, item number 27, which approved the appointment of an acting mayor in the absence of Mayor Kaliher, was adopted.

Public hearings were held for items number 28-31. The first public hearing was a relatively brief discussion on the vacating of public right-of-way in Merriam Park (item number 31). The second public hearing was on grievances about federal immigration operations (item number 30).

Several community members spoke out against the presence and actions of ICE in their communities, requesting stronger city action to protect residents. Councilor Yang acknowledged the bravery and courage shown by the testifiers.

The council then discussed a proposed revision to the separation ordinance, which includes no use of city property or resources for civil immigration enforcement, no St. Paul police department involvement in crowd control for ICE activities, and requiring clear identification for any arrest or detention within city limits.

In legislative hearing consent agenda items 32-53, item number 44 was discussed regarding the rehabilitation or removal of structures at 810 Maryland Avenue East. The council considered a motion to amend the resolution granting the building owner until March 1st to raise and remove the structure.

The meeting concluded with good news announcements from various council members, including the opening of a temporary Rondo community library location and the Groveland ice rink.
