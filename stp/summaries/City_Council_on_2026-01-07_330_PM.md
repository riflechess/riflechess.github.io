#### Summary

The meeting began with a moment of silence to acknowledge the recent tragic events in Minneapolis. The council then moved on to consider consent agenda items 3-24, adopting them without discussion.

Resolution 26-50 was reconsidered after being initially passed, and Dr. Pooja Zhang was invited to speak about her clinic's anniversary. The resolution was adopted as amended, declaring January 10, 2026, as Dr. Fuwa Zhang Day in the City of St. Paul.

The city attorney, Ms. Gao, was sworn in after her appointment was approved with a vote of six in favor and none opposed.

The council then held a public hearing on item 30, regarding federal immigration operations. Several community members spoke about their concerns with ICE's presence in the city and requested stronger protections for immigrants and residents. The council members acknowledged the importance of addressing these issues and promised to work towards strengthening the separation ordinance.

In legislative hearing consent agenda items 32-53, a public hearing was held on item 44, regarding the rehabilitation or removal of structures at 810 Maryland Avenue East. Representatives from CVS and community members spoke about their concerns with the current state of the property and requested more time for demolition and removal.

The council ultimately adopted the motion to amend the resolution granting until March 1st for the building to be removed.
