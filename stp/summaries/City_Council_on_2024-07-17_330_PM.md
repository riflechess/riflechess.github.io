Next, the Council considered a resolution (Public Hearing 24-165) authorizing the police department to accept additional funds and amend the 2024 special fund budget for an amended award for the Minnesota Department of Public Safety's enforcement grant program. Again, no public speakers were present, and the resolution was adopted by voice vote.

The City Council also addressed a public hearing on Item 17, which involved the mill and overlay project on Concordia Rondo from Snelling to Marion.
