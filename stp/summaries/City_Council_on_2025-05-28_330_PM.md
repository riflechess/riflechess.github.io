#### Summary

The City Council met on May 28th to discuss several key items. One of the main topics was the Department of Safety and Inspections' (DSI) request to impose a $1,000 matrix penalty and new license conditions on MFK Auto, a car dealership with two locations in Saint Paul. The licensee, Mo Kia, admitted to some of the violations but questioned the facts surrounding others. After hearing from both sides, the council voted to refer the matter to an administrative law judge for a hearing.

Next, the council heard a presentation by Dr. Heather Britt from Wilder Research on their assessment of the city's capital improvement budget process. The report highlighted several areas for improvement, including clarifying roles and responsibilities, simplifying the application process, and providing more support for community members. The council members expressed enthusiasm for implementing these recommendations.

The meeting also included a public hearing on resolutions related to sound level variances for events along Grand Avenue and amending the 2025 spending and budget in the Department of Public Works' right-of-way permits and inspection accounting unit. Additionally, the council held a legislative hearing consent agenda and adopted several resolutions without discussion.

Council members also shared various community events happening around the city, including a groundbreaking ceremony for the Highland Bridge Gateway Project, Water Fest at Bayland Regional Park, and a Popsicle pop-up meet and greet in Prosperity Heights Park.

Overall, the meeting covered a range of topics related to public safety, community development, and city operations.
