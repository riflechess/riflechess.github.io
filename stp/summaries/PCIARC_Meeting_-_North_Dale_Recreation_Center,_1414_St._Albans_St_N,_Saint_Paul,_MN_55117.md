#### Summary

The meeting began with introductions and swearing in of new Commissioner Aaron Hayes by Chair Sarah Floorman. The agenda was approved, and the chair's report mentioned an upcoming annual summit on Community First Public Safety.

Senior Commander Linsen from SPPD presented an update on encrypting radios, citing federal government requirements to encrypt private data transmitted over radio by January 1st, 2026. He discussed concerns about transparency and the potential for radio transmissions to reveal personal information. A dashboard is being developed to provide public information in real-time.

Commissioner Hayes questioned the impact of encryption on communication between SPPD and Ramsey County dispatchers. Senior Commander Linsen explained that encrypted channels would be used for coordination with other agencies, but not for routine communications.

The commission moved on to discussing the annual summit, which will feature presentations from Director Wiese, Chief Henry, and a panel discussion involving Commissioner Hayes. The summit's run of show was reviewed, and Coordinator Cumberland announced the addition of Director Angie Wiese as a speaker.

Deputy Director of Commerce Chair Florman reported on HERO Department activities, including outreach events and hiring processes. The department is still recruiting for an investigator position at the Labor Center.

IAU presented data on complaints received in April, with 8 total complaints, 2 forwarded to PCR Corps review, and 4 not sent to PCR Corps review. Commissioner Gross asked about the number of open criminal cases (3) and how investigations are handled when employees leave or resign.

The commission discussed the process for handling complaints when officers leave or are no longer employed by the city. The IAU would withdraw the complaint due to the lack of disciplinary action against a former employee.
