#### Summary
The CIB meeting covered various topics related to the city's budget and innovation initiatives. Some key points include:

* **Budget Allocations:** The council approved a budget allocation of $1 million for the creation of a new community arts program, which will provide funding for local artists and cultural events.
* **Public Safety:** The council discussed the recent increase in petty theft cases in the city and directed the police department to increase patrols in high-risk areas. Additionally, they approved a proposal to implement a community-based restorative justice program to address low-level offenses.
* **Business Development:** The council voted to approve a tax increment financing (TIF) plan for the proposed development of a new mixed-use building in the Frogtown neighborhood. However, Councilor Maria Hernandez expressed concerns about the potential impact on local small businesses and the need for more transparency in the TIF process.

The proposal to implement a community-based restorative justice program sparked a debate among council members. While some praised it as a progressive approach to addressing low-level offenses, others expressed concerns that it would be too expensive and may not effectively address underlying issues. The final vote was 6-3 in favor of the proposal, with Councilors Hernandez, Patel, and Jenkins opposing.

Overall, the meeting covered a range of topics related to city budgeting, public safety, and business development. While there were some contentious moments, particularly around the TIF plan and restorative justice program, the council made several key decisions aimed at addressing community concerns.
