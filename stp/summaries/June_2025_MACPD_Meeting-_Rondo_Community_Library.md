#### Summary
The meeting began with a presentation from the city's planning department on upcoming construction projects in the Rondo area. The main topics of discussion were:

* A proposed budget allocation for streetlight repairs and upgrades along 26th Street, which was met with some resistance from Nacre (corrected to Noecker), who argued that more resources should be dedicated to fixing potholes.
* A new business proposal for a coffee shop on University Avenue, which sparked a lively debate between community members about the potential impact on local businesses and parking. The developer assured the group that they would work with existing businesses to find solutions and address concerns.
* A presentation from the police department on community safety initiatives in the Rondo area, including increased foot patrols and neighborhood watch programs.

A vote was taken on the streetlight repair budget allocation, which passed 8-2, with Nacre (Noecker) and another council member voting against it. The developer's proposal for the coffee shop was tabled pending further discussion and community input.
