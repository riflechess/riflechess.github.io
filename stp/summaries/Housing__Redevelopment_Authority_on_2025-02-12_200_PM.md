The meeting started with the election of a new Chair and Vice-Chair. Commissioner Johnson was elected as the new Chair, replacing Noecker (corrected from "Noecker"), and Commissioner Joe was elected as the new Vice-Chair.

**Item 1: Resolution Approving Subordinating Existing HRA Debt**
The first item on the agenda was the approval of a resolution to subordinate existing HRA debt at 1068 Raymond Avenue. The motion was made by Vice Chair Jost, and it passed unanimously with six votes in favor and none opposed.

**Item 2: Introduction to Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) Program**
Rachel Fanazodal presented an introduction to the ERA program, which is a pilot project funded by a $1 million set-aside of Laha funds. The program aims to provide one-time payments to landlords to prevent evictions. Eligibility requirements include living within St. Paul, having an active lease, and demonstrating a need created by an unforeseen circumstance leading to an eviction notice.

**Item 3: Authorization to Designate F&C Development as Tentative Developer of Central Station Block**
The meeting then moved on to the authorization of Flaherty and Collins as the tentative developer for the Central Station Block. The proposal includes two buildings, a 20-story tower, and a six-story building connected by Skyway over the light rail. The estimated total development cost is $130 million.

**Item 4: Update on Properties under Agreement Citywide**
Director Newton presented an update on properties under agreement citywide, including tentative developer status (TDS) projects such as HAMS Brewery, 1036 Marshall Avenue, and 1570 White Bear Avenue. These projects are in various stages of development, with some nearing completion and others still seeking funding.

**Item 5: Update on Affordable Housing Projects**
The meeting concluded with an update on affordable housing projects, including Habitat at the Heights, Phase 1, Habitat's 890 to 7th Street project, Landmark Towers, Mary Hall, The Village on Rivoli, 652 Sherban Avenue, and Beacon Interface Housing Collaborative. These projects are expected to bring over 600 units of new housing online by mid-2026.

The meeting ended with a discussion of challenges facing the development process, including limited funding resources, increased construction costs, and delays caused by inexperienced developers. The HRA expressed its appreciation for the work being done by its staff and partners in bringing affordable housing to the city.
