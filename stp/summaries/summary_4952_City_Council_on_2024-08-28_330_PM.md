#### Summary

The meeting began with a roll call of council members, followed by the adoption of the consent agenda. The first item was Resolution 24-1229, which supplements the general resolution relating to sewer revenue bonds and provides for the issuance of sewer revenue bonds Series 2024 D.

Neil Young Hands from the Office of Financial Services presented the staff report on this item. He explained that the city had sold its 2024 D sewer revenue bonds in a competitive sale, raising $9 million for sewer projects. The bonds will fund the annual sewer program as well as part of the Water Street Sanitary Capacity Project.

Next, Councilmember Johnson presented a staff report on zoning amendments related to adult use cannabis facilities and retailers throughout the city. He explained that the state had legalized the possession, use, manufacturing, and sale of certain cannabis products, and cities are responsible for regulating their locations through zoning codes.

Council members raised several questions about the proposal, including the difference between micro and meso businesses, the regulation of lower potency hemp-derived edibles, and the creation of a new cannabis retail land use. Councilmember Bowie asked about the potential for a cap on the number of licenses or distance requirements between retail locations.

The council then voted to lay over the ordinance for further discussion and public hearing at a later date.

Later in the meeting, the council heard from multiple speakers on various items related to sound level variances and special tax assessments. Councilmember Yang moved to close the public hearings and approve the resolutions.

The final item was a legislative hearing consent agenda, which included several tax assessment appeals and a request for further discussion on illegal dumping issues. The council voted to lay over one of these items for further discussion.
