#### Summary

The meeting began with a staff report on a zoning issue involving Maryland Tobacco, Inc. The city attorney's office reported that the company had reached a settlement agreement to resolve issues related to zoning permits. The council approved the resolution with no opposition.

The next item was a resolution (25-192) ensuring fairness and equity in the implementation of administrative citations through a legislative advisory committee. Council Member Bowie presented the resolution, which aimed to establish a committee to advise on equitable practices in enforcing fines and fees. The council unanimously approved the resolution after discussion from several members, including Council Members Yang, Johnson, Nacre, and others.

The meeting also included final adoption of ordinances 25-2 and 25-3, which amended the city charter and zoning code, respectively. The council voted to adopt both ordinances with no opposition.

A public hearing was held on item 41, a tree preservation ordinance. Several speakers, including Judith Eljabelle and Tom Darling, expressed concerns about the proposed ordinance. Council Member Nacre suggested laying over the item for further input from stakeholders before final adoption. The motion passed with seven in favor and none opposed.

The council also discussed several other items, including resolutions related to funding for parks and recreation projects and a public hearing on an appeal of a rent stabilization determination. Council Member Yang presented her findings on the rent stabilization issue and proposed a maximum increase of 8% in rent for the affected tenants. The resolution passed with seven in favor and none opposed.

Finally, the council laid over item 75 (RLHTA 24-406) for further discussion on assistance programs for paying the assessment related to the demolition of a commercial building. Council Member Bowie suggested laying over the item for two weeks to allow time for discussions between her office, Ms. Mormon, and the representative of the family.

The meeting concluded with no other business to come before the council, and the adjournment was moved by the Council President.
