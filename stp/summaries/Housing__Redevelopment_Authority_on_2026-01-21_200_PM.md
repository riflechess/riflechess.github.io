The meeting discussed two main items:

	* Presented by Annie Brin, Project Manager on the Economic Development Team.
	* Discussed updates to the 2026 guidelines based on feedback from corridor organizations.
	* Key changes include:
		+ Extension of geography boundaries for certain corridors.
		+ Adjustment of grant sizes based on number of businesses (300 business threshold).
		+ Addition of language allowing flexibility in grant use.
	* Commissioner Bowie and Council President Noecker expressed concerns about using the number of businesses as a metric, suggesting alternative metrics such as length or density.
	* Director McMahon acknowledged these concerns and offered to revisit the data and consider alternative approaches.

Regarding operational support for business owners:

* Council Member Yang raised concerns about the current guidelines restricting use of Economic Development Star funds to capital purposes only.
* The city attorney's office was asked to provide clarification on this matter, with a memo to be issued by the end of the week.
* Discussion centered around potential changes to the guidelines or exploring alternative funding sources.

The meeting concluded with no further action items, and the next step is for staff to come back on February 11th with more information and seek approval.
