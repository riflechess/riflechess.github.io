* City Council meeting for the City of Saint Paul

#### Summary
The city council meeting began with a series of public service announcements and music, which were ignored. The first item on the agenda was Resolution 25-459, which aimed to appoint an interim award for a council member. However, the discussion quickly devolved into confusion and procedural disputes.

After several attempts to move forward with the resolution, the council recessed briefly to address the procedure for making motions. Upon returning from recess, the meeting continued with no further action taken on Resolution 25-459.

The rest of the meeting was dominated by repetitive thank-yous from the moderator, which occupied a significant amount of time and seemed unnecessary. The agenda was largely ignored, and the council failed to address any pressing issues or make meaningful decisions.

#### Highlights
* Procedural disputes: The council struggled with proper procedure for making motions, leading to confusion and delays.
* Lack of progress on key issues: Resolution 25-459, a potentially significant decision regarding council member appointments, was left unresolved due to procedural issues.
* Wasted time: A substantial amount of meeting time was spent on repetitive thank-yous from the moderator, which added no value to the discussion.
