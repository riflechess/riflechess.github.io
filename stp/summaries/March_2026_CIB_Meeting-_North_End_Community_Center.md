#### Summary
The CIB meeting focused on reviewing budget proposals for the North End Community Center. Key points from the discussion include:

* A proposed $200,000 allocation for renovations to the community center's gymnasium was approved with a unanimous vote.
* The committee discussed potential partnerships between the city and local businesses to provide programming and services at the community center. While there was some enthusiasm for this idea, no concrete plans were made.
* Concerns were raised about the lack of parking availability near the community center, particularly during events. This issue was noted as a priority for future discussion.

A contentious topic emerged when discussing the allocation of funds for youth programs. Council Member Lee expressed concerns that the proposed budget did not adequately address the needs of at-risk youth in the North End. Council Member Patel countered that the city had already committed significant resources to this area and that further investment would require additional funding sources. The discussion became heated, with some members accusing others of prioritizing politics over community needs. Ultimately, a compromise was reached, and $150,000 was allocated for youth programs.

The meeting concluded with a brief discussion about potential future events at the North End Community Center, including a proposed summer concert series.
