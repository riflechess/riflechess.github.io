#### Summary

The LSAC meeting covered several topics related to community development in Frogtown. Key decisions and updates include:

* **Affordable Housing**: The committee discussed potential sites for affordable housing developments in the area. A proposal was made to allocate $500,000 from the city's budget for land acquisition and development.
* **Community Garden**: The committee voted to approve a new community garden project on a vacant lot at 15th Avenue and Como Street. The project is expected to provide fresh produce to local residents and serve as an educational hub for gardening techniques.
* **Parks and Recreation**: A discussion was held regarding the maintenance of Frogtown's parks, with a focus on improving accessibility and safety features.

A notable point of contention arose during the discussion on affordable housing. Ward 4 Council Member, Maria Palmeri, expressed concerns about the potential impact on existing community organizations in the area. She argued that the proposed development could lead to gentrification and displace long-time residents. However, other committee members countered that the project aimed to provide much-needed affordable housing for low-income families.

The vote on allocating $500,000 for land acquisition was ultimately passed 7-3, with Palmeri and two other council members voting against it due to concerns over gentrification and community displacement.
