#### Summary

The LSAC meeting was attended by committee members and the public to discuss various special assessments for infrastructure projects in Saint Paul. The agenda included:

* **Infrastructure Projects:**
	+ Discussion on proposed sidewalk replacements on University Avenue
	+ Update on streetlight upgrades along Rice Street
	+ Review of the budget for the 2026 special assessment cycle
* **Public Comments:** Several residents spoke about concerns regarding flooding in their neighborhoods and requested assistance with stormwater management.

A contentious discussion arose during the review of the budget for the 2026 special assessment cycle. One committee member, Alderperson Martinez, expressed concerns that the proposed allocations did not adequately address the needs of low-income communities. The proposal was voted on with a slim majority (5-3), with Alderpeople Johnson and Thompson dissenting.

Alderperson Thompson stated, "We need to prioritize the needs of our most vulnerable residents. This budget doesn't do enough to support those who are struggling." Alderperson Johnson added, "I understand the concerns, but we also have to consider the overall impact on the city's infrastructure."

The meeting concluded with a vote to approve the proposed allocations for the 2026 special assessment cycle, pending further review and possible revisions.
