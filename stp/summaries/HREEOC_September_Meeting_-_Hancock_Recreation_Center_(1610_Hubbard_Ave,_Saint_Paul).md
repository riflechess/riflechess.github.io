#### Summary

The meeting began with Chair Christalie Bolfana introducing the commission members and their summer highlights. She then provided a high-level overview of the commission's bylaws and Robert's Rules of Order. The chair emphasized the importance of attendance records and encouraged commissioners to notify Mark, the secretary, if they plan to be absent from a meeting.

Director Ledger discussed the city's affirmative action/equal economic opportunity statement, which has not been reviewed since the 1980s. She explained that the commission will review the language and work on updating it over November and December meetings with the goal of completion by early 2026.

The discussion turned to the cyber incident that affected the city's systems in August. Commissioner Bolfana reported that all cloud-based systems were secure, but some traditional servers and legacy systems were impacted. The commission is working to restore these systems and has had to implement a work-from-home posture due to the compromised network.

Mike Madden, representing the Committee to Cut the Waterfall Contract, presented two sample resolutions from Iowa City and Saint Paul Regional Water Services. The committee is advocating for the city to refrain from economic cooperation with Israel due to concerns about the company's ties to the Israeli government and its role in developing offensive cyber security tools.

Commissioner Fair noted that the company in question provides data security services to the water service, which has a high level of sensitivity. He expressed concern about the potential risks associated with using a company based in Israel.

Director Ledger offered to review the single source process used by the city to determine if there were any alternative providers for the data security contract. The RFI (Request for Information) process is currently underway, and the commission will continue to discuss this topic in October.

The meeting concluded with the chair inviting commissioners to stay for a short committee discussion and thanking Mike Madden for his presentation.
