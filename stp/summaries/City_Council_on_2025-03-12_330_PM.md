#### Summary
The meeting began with a tribute to the late Officer Felicia Riley and discussion about the city's current challenges, including recent business closures.

Council Member Bowie introduced Resolution 25-434, which aimed to establish a Public Safety Committee. However, Council Member Johnson expressed concerns about transparency in the committee's formation and asked for more intentional meetings with relevant entities. After some discussion, the resolution was laid over for two weeks to allow for further review.

The meeting then moved on to discuss the Green New Deal Resolution (Resolution 25-24), which aims to guide future policy in St. Paul towards a more sustainable and equitable city. The resolution received unanimous support from the council members present.

Other notable items discussed included:

* A grant opportunity from the Office of Cannabis Management's Can Renew Grant, which has $970,000 available for eligible applicants.
* Several ordinances related to zoning, water rates, and plumbing codes, which were laid over for further review or public hearing.
* A resolution authorizing the city to accept up to $30,000 from the state-funded IIJ8 technical assistance program.

The meeting also featured a presentation by Director Rodriguez of the Parks and Recreation Department, who announced the soft opening of the North End Community Center and thanked Council Vice President Kim for her work on the project.

The meeting concluded with a visit from a group of college students participating in the Civic Bridges program, who were interested in learning about local government and civic engagement.
