The meeting began with a discussion on Resolution 26-231, which approved the appointment of Kamaria Kasim as the Director of Human Resources. The resolution was adopted unanimously.

Next, Council Member Yang presented a resolution (Resolution 26-253) calling on the State of Minnesota and Governor Walz to enact an energy and gas shutoff moratorium to protect residents harmed by federal government attacks. Several speakers testified in support of the resolution, highlighting the impact of ICE operations on their communities.

The council then moved on to consider Ordinance 26-7, which would prohibit law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings or personal disguises while conducting operations. Council Member Yang and Vice President Kim expressed strong support for the ordinance, citing concerns about public safety and accountability.

A public hearing was held on Ordinance 26-6, which requires law enforcement officers to display identification on their uniforms. Several speakers testified in support of the ordinance, including a Hmong community leader who emphasized the importance of visibility and accountability.

The council also considered Resolution Public Hearing 26-13, ratifying an assessment for repair of sanitary sewer lines on private properties, and Resolution Public Hearing 26-14, ratifying an assessment for replacement of lead water service lines on private properties. Both resolutions were adopted unanimously.

A public hearing was held on Item Number 15, which authorized the extension of a grant to Forward Edge ASIC LLC under the Minnesota Investment Fund Program. Several speakers testified against the extension, citing concerns about Lockheed Martin's involvement in human rights abuses and violence. The council ultimately voted not to extend the contract.

The meeting concluded with a public hearing on Item Number 20, which established the festivals and events security credit. Council Member Bowie presented version two of the resolution, which would provide funding for community-led festivals and events. Several speakers testified in support of the resolution, including representatives from the Westside Boosters and the Hmong International Freedom Festival.

The council voted to lay over Item Number 21, a public hearing on grievances about federal immigration operations, until February 11th. Several speakers testified against ICE's actions and urged the council to pass stronger separation ordinances.

Finally, the meeting concluded with a public hearing on Legislative Hearing Consent Agenda items 22 through 32. A representative from Camper Memorial United Methodist Church spoke in support of the consent agenda, thanking the legislative hearing officer for their work. The council voted to adopt the consent agenda as amended.

Overall, the meeting focused on addressing concerns related to public safety, community events, and economic development. Several speakers emphasized the need for stronger leadership and more decisive action from the city council in response to federal immigration operations.
