#### Summary

The meeting began with the introduction of various ordinances and resolutions for consideration by the City Council. The first item discussed was Resolution 26-231, which approved the appointment of Kamaria Kasim as the Director of Human Resources. The resolution passed unanimously.

Next, the council considered Ordinance 26-5, which added Chapter 268 to the Legislative Code to prohibit law enforcement staging operations on city-owned properties and limit access to non-public city spaces. The ordinance was adopted without opposition.

The council also discussed Ordinance 26-7, which requires law enforcement officers to conduct their operations without a mask or facial covering unless certain exceptions apply. After a detailed presentation by Tim Greenfield, the Chief Policy Officer for the City Council, the council voted to lay over the ordinance until next week for a public hearing.

During the public hearings section of the agenda, the council heard testimony on Ordinance 26-6, which requires law enforcement officers to visibly display identification. The public hearing was closed and the item was laid over until next week for final adoption.

The council also considered Item number 15, which authorized the extension of the terms of the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development Grant under the Minnesota Investment Fund Program for Forward Edge ASIC LLC. Several residents spoke out against the grant, citing concerns about Lockheed Martin's involvement in human rights abuses and the use of taxpayer money to fund violence abroad.

The council ultimately voted to deny the contract extension for Forward Edge ASIC, with six members voting in favor of the motion and none opposed.

Additionally, the council discussed a resolution public hearing 26-37, establishing the festivals and events security credit. The council allocated $155,000 ongoing in their general fund last year to try to help relieve the burden of security costs on festival organizers.

The meeting concluded with a discussion on the implementation of the credit and how it would be administered by the police department. The council voted to hold a public hearing on this item next week.

Overall, the meeting was marked by passionate testimony from residents on various issues, including immigration policy, law enforcement accountability, and economic development. The council's votes on these items reflected their commitment to addressing these concerns and working towards a more just and equitable community.
