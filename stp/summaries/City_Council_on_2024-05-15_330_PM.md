#### Summary
The meeting began with a discussion on Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for the Ecuadorian community. The City Council voted unanimously to adopt a resolution in support of TPS, which was met with appreciation from Claudia Laines and others who have been advocating for this cause.

Next, the council discussed Item 16, regarding a tobacco shop license held by Maryland Amico BP Marketplace. The Department of Safety and Inspections (DSI) recommended adverse action against the license due to prohibited flavored tobacco products being found on the premises twice in 2023 and 2024. The licensee proposed surrendering the license voluntarily, but DSI opposed this, citing concerns about the impact on future business. After discussion, the council voted unanimously to adopt version one of the resolution, which allows DSI to proceed with the ALJ hearings and continue on the path to revoke the tobacco shop license.

The council then moved on to Item 17, considering an appeal from Snelling Midway Redevelopment LLC regarding a proposed restaurant building on the property at 1566 University Avenue West. The applicant requested two zoning variances: one for the percentage of windows required and another for the primary pedestrian entrance. After hearing public comments and staff reports, Council Member Bowie motioned to approve both variances, citing the unique circumstances of this development and its potential to bring vibrancy back to the Midway area.

The council then discussed several resolutions related to sound level variances for various events at different locations. Chris Johnson, a neighbor who lives near Skinner's Pub, spoke about his concerns regarding excessive noise levels from the pub's events, which he said aggravate his mental health issues and panic attacks. Rebecca Ramsden, Chris's mother, also testified on his behalf. The Skinners responded to these comments, stating that they try to be good neighbors and have made efforts in the past to accommodate their neighbors' concerns.

The meeting concluded with a discussion on legislative hearing consent agenda items 24 through 54. No public comment was heard on these items, and the council voted unanimously to approve them as amended.
