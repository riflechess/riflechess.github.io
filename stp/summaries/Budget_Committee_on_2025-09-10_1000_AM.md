#### Summary
The meeting began with an overview of the 2026 proposed budget by Madeline Mitchell, Budget Manager. The budget has a starting gap of $23 million due to inflationary salary and fringe growth, reabsorbing costs from the American Rescue Plan (ARP), funding debt levy, and covering other obligations.

To close this gap, the budget includes:

* A 5.3% property tax levy increase
* Updating projections to book an additional $4.1 million in non-levy revenue
* Reviewing staffing levels and identifying vacancies that could be removed from the budget (42.73 positions)
* Department reductions totaling $5.4 million
* New spending, including a net increase of $166,000 for a team within the city attorney's office to manage data requests, and investments in technology and cybersecurity infrastructure

The 2026 proposed capital budget is $151.7 million, with primary revenue sources being GEO capital improvement bonds and CDBG/CIB department processes.

Council Members expressed support for various initiatives, including:

* Funding for district councils
* Maintaining funding for the free swimming pilot at Jimmy Lee
* Money for commercial corridor assistance programs

However, some Council Members raised concerns about:

* The alignment of priorities with budget decisions
* Communication between OFS and the Council on proposed changes
* Supplementing one-time dollars to support staff in special funds rather than the general fund

Some notable discussions included:

* The impact of paramedic fees being lower than expected
* The reimbursement from insurance companies for governmental services
* The shift in property values changing who pays what in taxes
* The importance of considering the unique roles and services provided by the city, such as rec centers and libraries

The meeting concluded with a plan to review department presentations on their specific reductions and vacancies, and continued discussions on communication between OFS and the Council.
