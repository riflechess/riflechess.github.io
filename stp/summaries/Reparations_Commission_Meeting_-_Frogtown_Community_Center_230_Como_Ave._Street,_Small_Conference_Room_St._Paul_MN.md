#### Summary

The Reparations Commission meeting focused on ongoing efforts to address historical injustices and provide reparations to the community. Key discussion points included:

* The commission discussed a proposal to establish a $10 million fund for reparations initiatives, including housing, education, and economic development programs.
* A draft report outlining potential reparations projects was presented, which includes:
	+ Homebuyer assistance program
	+ Community land trust development
	+ Education and job training initiatives
	+ Economic development incentives
* Commissioner Rachel Johnson raised concerns about the scope of the proposal, suggesting it may not be sufficient to address systemic issues. She advocated for a more comprehensive approach.
* Commissioner John Thompson proposed adding a clause to ensure that 20% of the fund is allocated directly to Frogtown residents.

There was some tension during the discussion, particularly between Commissioners Johnson and Thompson regarding the allocation of funds. Commissioner Johnson emphasized the need for a more equitable distribution, while Commissioner Thompson argued that prioritizing Frogtown residents would be a positive step towards addressing historical injustices in the community.

The meeting concluded with a vote to advance the proposal to the city council for further discussion and potential approval. The commission will hold a follow-up meeting next month to review progress and continue discussions on reparations initiatives.
