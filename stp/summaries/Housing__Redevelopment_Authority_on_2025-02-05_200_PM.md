#### Summary

The meeting began with a discussion on the minutes from the previous HRA meeting, which were approved unanimously. The commission then moved to consider three items under suspension of the rules.

The first item was Resolution 25-237, which amended the HRA's World Trade Center Parking Enterprise Fund budget to reflect a transfer of $51,818 from the HRA to the PED Operations Fund. The resolution was approved unanimously.

The second item was Resolution 25-240, which authorized the execution of a master legal services agreement with Ballard-Spar, LLP. This agreement would provide bond counsel and related public finance legal services for the HRA in consultation with the city attorney's office. The commission approved this resolution unanimously.

The third item was Resolution 25-243, which also authorized the execution of a master legal services agreement with Barna, Guzzi, and Stephan, Limited. This agreement would provide similar services as the previous one. The commission approved this resolution unanimously.

Next, the commission heard a staff report on Item 5, which related to an HRA loan subordination for 1068 Raymond Avenue. Principal Project Manager Angela Reif presented the item, which involved requesting subordination of new debt to the first mortgage lender and extending the maturity date of the declaration of covenants and the note to be coterminous with the first mortgage loan dated October 7, 2024.

Commissioner Bruey asked questions about the item, clarifying that the HRA was not extending any additional credit, but rather allowing existing owners to take out additional debt ahead of the HRA. Commissioner Yang also asked for clarification on the staff recommendation, which was to approve the additional debt and extend the maturity date.

The commission did not vote on this item at this meeting, but it will be brought forward for action at a future meeting.

Finally, Chair Johnson took a moment of privilege to acknowledge the upcoming leadership transition within the HRA and express her support for Commissioner Yang's appointment as chair and Commissioner Joseph's appointment as vice chair.
