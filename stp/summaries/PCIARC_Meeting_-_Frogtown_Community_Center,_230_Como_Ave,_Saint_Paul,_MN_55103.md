#### Summary

The meeting began with introductions from new commissioners, including Sarah Florman, Sierra, John Linson, Amy Boyer, Steve Petron, Beth Commerce, Catherine Grills, Nancy Rodenberg, Dan Featherstone, Chanel Webb, Mike Redmaker, Laura Forsham, and Kathy. The commissioners were sworn in by Chair Foreman on behalf of the mayor's office.

The meeting minutes from February 5th and March 5th were approved without opposition. Commissioner Portia mentioned that the PCR has a new process for handling complaints independently submitted through email or letter, which was explained by Coordinator Cumberland. This process allows community members to provide complaints in various formats and ensures flexibility in the submission process.

The Hero Department Report discussed the department's efforts to address problem properties, including CVS on the corner of Snellingham University. Commissioner Rosenberg expressed concerns about issuing fines to corporations versus individuals and asked why a $50,000 fine was not being considered. Coordinator Plummers explained that due process would be followed in such cases, with opportunities for appeal.

The presentation and discussion on the PCR complaint review process were led by Coordinator Cumberland. The process involves reviewing complaints, conducting investigations, and making recommendations to Chief Henry. Commissioners asked questions about accessing policies and procedures, technology issues, and the role of police officers in providing testimony.

A mock training process was suggested by Commissioner Robert to help new commissioners understand the PCR process. Chair Foreman emphasized the importance of following Robert's rules of order during deliberations.

The commission approved a policy allowing for more flexibility in handling complaints submitted independently through email or letter. Coordinator Cumberland explained that this process ensures community members can provide complaints in various formats and facilitates the submission process.

Finally, community updates were shared by Coordinator Carmelin, including an upcoming event at the Highland District Council's annual meeting and an understanding and responding to mass incarceration conference at Metropolitan State University.
