**Purpose:** Discussion and review of proposed changes to the Planned Community zoning ordinance
**Date/Time:** [Insert Date and Time]
**Location:** Frogtown Community Center, 230 Como Ave, Saint Paul, MN 55103

#### Summary
The PCIARC meeting discussed several proposals for amendments to the Planned Community zoning ordinance. One proposal aimed to reduce the minimum lot size requirement in certain areas of the city, while another sought to establish stricter regulations on commercial development.

A key topic of discussion was a proposal to allow for more density in certain neighborhoods, including Frogtown and Summit-University. Some committee members expressed concerns about increased traffic and strain on local infrastructure if population density increases.

The committee also heard from several community members who spoke out against the proposals, citing concerns about overdevelopment and potential negative impacts on quality of life.

A motion was made to approve the reduced lot size proposal, but it failed to pass with a 4-3 vote. The stricter regulations on commercial development were approved with a unanimous vote.

The meeting also touched on the topic of affordable housing, with some committee members advocating for increased inclusionary zoning requirements to ensure that developers set aside units for low-income residents.

No decisions were made regarding the proposal to allow more density in certain neighborhoods. The discussion was tabled until the next meeting, where further review and debate are expected.
