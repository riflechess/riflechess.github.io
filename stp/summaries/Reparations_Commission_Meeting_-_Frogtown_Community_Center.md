#### Summary
The Reparations Commission Meeting was attended by community members, stakeholders, and city officials. The main topics of discussion were:

* **Policy Proposals:** The commission presented three policy proposals aimed at addressing systemic inequalities in housing, education, and economic development. Each proposal outlined specific goals, target populations, and implementation strategies.
	+ Proposal 1: Allocate $2 million towards community land trusts to increase affordable housing options for low-income families.
	+ Proposal 2: Establish a mentorship program for high school students from historically underrepresented groups, focusing on STEM education and career development.
	+ Proposal 3: Create a small business loan program with zero-interest loans for entrepreneurs from marginalized communities.
* **Budget Allocation:** The commission voted to allocate $1.5 million towards the first proposal (community land trusts), but there was significant debate over the allocation of funds for the other two proposals. Commissioner Rachel Johnson expressed concerns about the potential duplication of efforts, while Commissioner Marcus Thompson argued that the small business loan program is crucial for economic development.
* **Public Safety:** Community members raised concerns about public safety in Frogtown, citing instances of violence and property crime. The commission agreed to work with local law enforcement to develop strategies for improving community policing and addressing root causes of crime.

The meeting concluded with a sense of urgency and commitment from the commission to move forward with implementing policy proposals. However, some members expressed frustration over the lack of concrete timelines and milestones for implementation.
