#### Meeting Info
**Meeting Type:** Reparations Commission Meeting
**Purpose:** To discuss the implementation and progress of reparations in Saint Paul, particularly in the Frogtown neighborhood
**Date/Time:** Wednesday, March 15, 2023, 6:00 PM
**Location:** Frogtown Community Center

#### Summary
The meeting focused on updates from various subcommittees working on different aspects of reparations. Some key points include:

* The Sub-Committee on Housing reported that they are exploring partnerships with local developers to create affordable housing units in historically redlined areas.
* The Economic Justice Sub-Committee discussed proposals for community land trusts and cooperatives as a way to promote community ownership and control over resources.
* The Healing and Restorative Justice Sub-Committee presented a plan for creating a reparations-focused curriculum for Saint Paul schools.

One area of contention arose during the discussion on funding allocations. Commissioner Maria Rodriguez expressed concern that the proposed budget for housing initiatives was not sufficient, given the scope of the problem in Frogtown. Commissioner John Taylor countered that they needed to balance short-term needs with long-term sustainability, and that further funding would require a larger allocation from the city's general fund.

The commission ultimately voted 7-2 to allocate $1 million towards affordable housing initiatives, with Commissioners Rodriguez and James Johnson dissenting due to concerns about insufficient funding. The meeting concluded with a call for continued community engagement and participation in shaping reparations efforts.
