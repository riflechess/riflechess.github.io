#### Meeting Info
* **Meeting Type:** Reparations Commission Meeting
* **Purpose:** Discussion on reparations proposals for the City of Saint Paul, particularly focusing on the Frogtown community
* **Date/Time:** February 20, 2023, at 6:00 PM
* **Location:** Frogtown Community Center

#### Summary
The meeting began with an overview of the Reparations Commission's goals and objectives. Key points discussed included:
* A proposed $1 million allocation for community-led projects aimed at addressing systemic inequalities in housing, education, and economic development.
* Recommendations for establishing a permanent reparations fund to support ongoing initiatives.

A contentious point arose when Commissioner Thompson suggested that a portion of the allocated funds be directed towards creating affordable housing options for low-income residents. However, Commissioner Patel expressed concerns about diverting resources away from other essential community programs.

Commissioner Lee introduced a motion to increase the proposed allocation by an additional $500,000, citing need for more comprehensive support. The vote on this amendment was 4-2 in favor of increasing the funding.

The meeting concluded with agreement that further discussion and public input are necessary before finalizing reparations proposals.
