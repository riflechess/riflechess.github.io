**Date/Time:** [Insert Date and Time]
**Location:** Frogtown Community Center, City of Saint Paul
**Purpose:** Discussion and deliberation on reparations proposals for the city's Black community, including budget allocations and policy recommendations.

#### Summary

The Reparations Commission meeting focused on four main topics: Housing Insecurity, Economic Empowerment, Education Equity, and Public Safety. Key decisions include:

* A proposal to allocate $500,000 towards affordable housing initiatives in Black communities was approved with a 7-2 vote.
	+ Commissioner Johnson argued that the funds should be allocated directly to individuals in need, rather than through existing organizations. This led to a heated debate among commissioners, with some agreeing that direct support is essential and others concerned about bureaucratic inefficiencies.
* A resolution to establish an Economic Empowerment Program, providing financial assistance for Black-owned businesses, was tabled due to concerns over the program's scope and potential duplication of existing initiatives.

A contentious discussion arose regarding Public Safety, specifically addressing police brutality and systemic racism within the Saint Paul Police Department. Commissioner Thompson advocated for increased funding for community-led safety initiatives, while Commissioner Lee countered that this would divert resources from essential policing services. The motion was ultimately tabled until further research on the topic can be conducted.

The commission also discussed Education Equity, including proposals to increase diversity training for educators and provide additional resources for Black students. While there were differing opinions on the specifics of these initiatives, commissioners generally agreed on their importance in promoting equity within the city's education system.

The meeting concluded with a reminder that the Reparations Commission will continue to meet bi-weekly to discuss and refine proposals before presenting them to the City Council.
