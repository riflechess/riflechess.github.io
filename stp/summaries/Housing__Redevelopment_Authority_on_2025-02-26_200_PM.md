#### Summary

The Housing & Redevelopment Authority (HRA) meeting focused on two main topics: Planning and Zoning Studies 101 and an Introduction to Commerce Building Phase 1 and 2. The first topic was led by Director Anton Dervy, who presented a comprehensive overview of planning studies, including their types, initiators, prioritization, and implementation tools.

Commissioners discussed the complexity of planning studies and how they relate to each other. They touched on the need for better communication between district councils and the city's planning department regarding neighborhood plans and their updates. The discussion highlighted the challenges of keeping plans up-to-date due to staffing constraints and changes in community priorities over time.

The second topic, Introduction to Commerce Building Phase 1 and 2, was withdrawn from the agenda with potential for future return.

Key points:

* Planning studies are categorized into four basic kinds: citywide plans, small area plans, zoning studies, and master plans.
* These studies help guide land use decisions and direct city funding.
* Neighborhood plans should ideally be updated at the same time as the comprehensive plan (every 10 years).
* The decertification process can be challenging for district councils to navigate.
* Staffing capacity is a significant challenge in keeping up with neighborhood plan updates.
* Commissioners discussed the importance of prioritizing and implementing planning studies effectively.

No contentious votes or disagreements were noted during this meeting.
