#### Summary

The meeting began with a review of upcoming projects and proposals. Notable items include:

* A proposal to rezone a property in the West End for a new mixed-use development (supporting comments from local business owners)
* Discussion on implementing a bike-share program in Saint Paul
* Review of the city's current comprehensive plan

A contentious issue arose regarding a proposed rezoning request in the Summit-University neighborhood. The proposal, which would allow for increased density and taller buildings, was met with opposition from some community members who expressed concerns about gentrification and potential displacement of long-time residents.

After a lengthy discussion, the committee voted 5-3 to recommend approval of the rezoning request, with several amendments aimed at addressing the community's concerns. The proposal will now move forward for consideration by the Planning Commission.

Other notable decisions include:

* Approval of a new liquor license for a business in the downtown area
* Support for a grant application to fund a community garden project in the Rondo neighborhood
