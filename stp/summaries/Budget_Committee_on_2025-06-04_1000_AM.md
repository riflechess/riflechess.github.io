#### Summary

The meeting began with a presentation by Dr. Anthony Becker, State Economist, and Amanda Einz, Manager of the Economic Analysis Unit at the Minnesota Management and Budget (MMB). They discussed the economic forecast for the United States and Minnesota, highlighting the impact of policy uncertainty on the economy.

Some key points from the presentation include:

* The forecast predicts low growth in GDP, below 2%, due to trade policies and tariffs.
* Inflation is expected to rise, with a potential spike in the second quarter.
* The Federal Reserve's monetary policy will likely remain unchanged until December, with possible rate cuts in 2026.
* Business fixed investment is expected to decline, which can precede a recession.

Amanda Imes discussed Minnesota's economy, highlighting its diverse industry base and high levels of innovation. She noted that the state has a strong headquarters economy and a highly educated labor force, but faces challenges related to population growth and immigration.

Some key points from Amanda Imes' presentation include:

* Minnesota has a triple-A rating and consistently ranks high in quality-of-life indicators.
* The state has a diverse industry base, with a large share of employment in healthcare services, manufacturing, and financial activities.
* Fortune 500 companies are concentrated in Minnesota, particularly in the Twin Cities.

The discussion turned to the implications for St. Paul's budget, with Council Members asking about the impact on poverty rates, unemployment rates, and wages. Dr. Becker and Amanda Imes noted that while some of these metrics may be affected by national trends, Minnesota's economy is expected to respond similarly to the U.S. economy.

Council President Noecker asked about the recommendations for city elected officials as they enter budget season. Dr. Becker suggested considering livability, taxes, arts, social situation, job location, and education, while Amanda Imes emphasized the importance of education, connecting people to jobs, and affordable housing.

Finally, Council Member Johnson asked about the advice being given to the legislature regarding fiscal policy, particularly in light of potential economic uncertainty. Dr. Becker and Amanda Imes noted that cities should be aware of potential revenue shortfalls and plan accordingly, considering a lower bound for sales tax revenue and other streams of revenue.

The meeting concluded with thanks to Dr. Becker and Amanda Imes for their time and expertise, and the announcement of Council Vice Chair Kim's assumption of chairing duties while Chair Yang is on maternity leave.
