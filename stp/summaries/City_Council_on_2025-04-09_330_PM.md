#### Summary

The meeting began with a review of consent agenda items, which were adopted without discussion. 

The first major item discussed was the ratification of appealed special tax assessments for vacant building fees in various properties across the city. The council heard testimony from property owners and residents regarding their concerns about these fees, particularly those related to the length of time it takes to complete renovations or repairs.

Next, the council discussed a motion to create a public safety committee, which would oversee policy development and review legislation in areas such as police, fire, and emergency services. Council Member Bowie advocated for the creation of this committee, citing the importance of prioritizing public safety within the city's structure.

The meeting then turned to an ordinance amending Chapter 310.04 of the Legislative Code to regulate a more efficient method of cancellation when licensees are not in compliance with providing materials for licensed activities. Director Angie Wiese presented the staff report on this item, explaining that the current process can lead to issues such as businesses staying open without necessary licenses.

Following this, the council held public hearings on Ordinance 25-21 and 25-29, which relate to zoning changes and rent stabilization, respectively. Testimony was heard from various stakeholders, including developers, renters, and community members, regarding their concerns about these ordinances.

Finally, the meeting concluded with a discussion on two major items: an amendment to the rent stabilization ordinance (Ordinance 2529) and an ordinance creating Chapter 193 of the Legislative Code pertaining to tenant protections (Ordinance 2531). 

For Ordinance 25-29, testimony was heard from developers, renters, and community members regarding their concerns about this ordinance. Many speakers emphasized that this amendment would provide a more stable environment for new construction and attract investment in the city.

For Ordinance 2531, which pertains to tenant protections, testimony was given by renters who have faced challenges with evictions and security deposits. Many supported the ordinance, highlighting its importance in providing clear guidelines and protections for renters.

Council Member Provatsky noted that he has concerns regarding some of the language in Ordinances 25-29 and 2531 but generally supports their goals. Council Members Jost and Nacre expressed similar sentiments, with a focus on ensuring fairness for all parties involved.

Overall, the meeting highlighted various concerns about housing development and rental regulations within St. Paul. While there were differing opinions regarding the proposed ordinances, many speakers emphasized that prioritizing public safety and providing clear guidelines for renters are essential components of any policy related to housing.
