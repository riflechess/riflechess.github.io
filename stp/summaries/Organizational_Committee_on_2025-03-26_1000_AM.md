#### Summary

The Organizational Committee meeting focused on two main topics: federal funding impacts and immigration-related policies. Lindsey Bakker presented an in-depth analysis of the current federal funding landscape, including executive orders, memos, and court rulings that have affected grant programs and contracts. The City of Saint Paul has approximately $260 million in receivable federal funding, with about $192 million in grants actively under contract.

Edmund Oli Ho, Assistant City Attorney, discussed recent changes in federal immigration policy, including executive orders on birthright citizenship, refugee resettlement programs, expedited removal, and designation of cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. He highlighted the impact of these policies on local communities, particularly regarding sanctuary cities and the denial of federal funding to jurisdictions that do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.

The committee also discussed the importance of educating immigrant communities about their rights and providing resources for emergency planning. The city has created a webpage with information on food, healthcare, housing, legal assistance, education, transportation, and other resources available to immigrants. Assistant City Attorney Ho emphasized the need for families to develop emergency plans and prepare documents such as DOPA (declaration of parental or delegation of parental authority) and limited power of attorney.

The committee members expressed their appreciation for the presentations and acknowledged the complexity of the issues discussed. They also recognized the importance of continuing to support immigrant communities through education, resources, and advocacy.

Some notable points of contention include:

* The potential impact of federal funding freezes on local projects and services
* The city's stance on sanctuary policies and its commitment to upholding the separation ordinance
* The challenges faced by immigrant communities in navigating complex immigration policies and accessing necessary resources

Overall, the meeting highlighted the need for continued dialogue and collaboration between the city, community organizations, and residents to address the evolving landscape of federal funding and immigration policies.
