The Heritage Preservation Commission met to discuss several preservation-related items. Key decisions include:

* **Delayed discussion on the proposed demolition of a 19th-century house**: The commission tabled further discussion on the proposed demolition due to concerns raised by community members about the potential loss of historic architecture.

There was no significant public comment or debate on the approved renovation plans. However, there were some concerns raised by one commissioner regarding the potential impact on the surrounding neighborhood's character.

The delayed discussion on the proposed demolition is expected to be revisited at a future meeting.
