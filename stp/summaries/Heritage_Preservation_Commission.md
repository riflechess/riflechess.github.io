#### Summary
The Heritage Preservation Commission met to discuss various preservation-related topics. Key points include:

* The commission approved the nomination of the Summit Hill neighborhood's historic homes for recognition on the National Register of Historic Places.
* Design review discussions took place regarding two proposed new buildings in the Old Saint Paul area. After some debate, the HPC voted 5-2 to approve a modified design that addresses concerns about visibility and scale.
	+ Commissioner Johnson argued that the approved design does not adequately consider the historical context of the area, citing potential negative impacts on the character of the neighborhood.
	+ Commissioner Thompson countered that the modifications made will preserve the integrity of nearby historic structures while allowing for necessary growth and modernization.
* The commission also discussed plans to revitalize the exterior of a 19th-century building along the Grand Avenue commercial corridor. This project is expected to include facade restoration, improved signage, and enhanced public spaces.

A contentious debate arose when Commissioner Lee presented concerns about gentrification pressures in areas undergoing revitalization efforts. She expressed worries that these changes might push long-time residents out of their homes due to rising property values. Commissioners generally acknowledged her points but focused on finding solutions that balance preservation with community needs.

The next meeting's agenda will be set at the end of this session, and further information can be found on the City of Saint Paul's website.
