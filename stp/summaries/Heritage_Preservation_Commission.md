#### Summary
The Heritage Preservation Commission met to discuss two main issues: a proposal for the removal of a contributing garage at 1846 Summit Avenue in the Summit Avenue West Historic District and a proposal to replace the cedar roofing and curved eaves on an English cottage-style structure at 482 Portland Avenue in the Hill Heritage Preservation District.

For the first issue, staff recommended approval of the demolition of the historic two-stall garage and construction of a new one with conditions. The applicant agreed to consider salvaging as much of the historic brick as possible for use on the new garage and to make adjustments to the design to better relate to the main building.

The second issue involved a proposal to replace the cedar roofing and curved eaves on an English cottage-style structure at 482 Portland Avenue in the Hill Heritage Preservation District. The staff report highlighted several concerns, including that the alteration of the curved eaves does not conform with St. Paul Legislative Code, Chapter 74 Standards. However, the applicant presented evidence of economic hardship due to the high cost of repairing or replacing the cedar roof and the fact that their insurance will no longer cover it.

The commission discussed the proposal extensively, considering the costs of repair versus replacement, the feasibility of finding a suitable product for the curved eaves, and the reversibility of the proposed changes. After a lengthy discussion, Commissioner Osteen made a motion to approve the application with three conditions: that estimates show an economic hardship, work can be reversed in the future, and the owner will lose insurance if cedar is not replaced.

The motion was seconded by Commissioner Rink, but Commissioner McDonald expressed concerns about the eyebrow dormer and suggested revisiting its design. The commission voted 3-2 to approve the application with the three conditions.

Note: There was a significant amount of discussion on the issue of the curved eaves and whether it is feasible to find a suitable product that can be bent to replicate the original shape.
