#### Summary
The meeting covered three main topics related to the 2010 Summit Avenue property, which is part of the Summit West Heritage Preservation District. The Commission approved:

1. The demolition of an existing accessory structure at 2010 Summit Avenue, with a vote of 5-0.
2. The construction of a new garage at 2010 Summit Avenue, with a vote of 5-0 (after some discussion about design and visibility).

However, there was some contention regarding the design of the garage door. Commissioner Saylor expressed concerns that designing a single-door to look like two doors could be "disingenuous" and asked if there was a direct historical requirement for smaller doors. The applicant, Terra Firma Building and Remodeling, agreed to consider making changes.

The third topic, related to construction at the rear of the house (including a mudroom, living room, kitchen, fencing, and landscape improvements), was also approved with a vote of 5-0. However, there was some discussion about not seeing a sample of the rustic and smooth hardy material proposed for the project.

The meeting concluded with a motion to adjourn, but some questions were raised about another item that had been removed from the agenda due to the libraries' decision not to participate at this time.
