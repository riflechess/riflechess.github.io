#### Summary
The meeting began with the swearing-in of new Commissioner Eric Foster. The agenda was adopted without controversy.

The main topic of discussion was the proposal to construct a detached garage at 985 Summit Avenue, which is part of the James A. Wilson House, a heritage-protected site in the Hill District. Allison Eggers, senior heritage preservation specialist, presented the project and outlined the design, which met all heritage preservation guidelines. The owner, Sylvia Hillen, and contractor, Rob Thomas, also spoke about their plans.

Commissioners praised the design for being respectful of the historic area and matching the existing carriage house. Some commissioners noted that the garage would still be a garage but might be converted to storage after completion.

The commission voted unanimously (7-0) to approve the construction of the detached garage, as recommended by staff.

After the public hearing, the meeting concluded with no further discussion or action items.
