#### Meeting Info

**Type:** Heritage Preservation Commission (HPC) meeting
**Purpose:** To discuss preservation and historic designation of properties in Saint Paul, as well as other related business
**Date/Time:** March 12, 2023, at 2:00 PM

#### Summary

The meeting began with a discussion on the proposed historic designation of three buildings in the Summit-University neighborhood. After some debate, the commission voted to approve the designation for two of the buildings but tabled the third due to concerns about potential impact on local businesses.

* **Approved:** 1460 University Avenue West (former restaurant) and 1533 Selby Avenue (historic church)
* **Tabled:** 1217 University Avenue East (mixed-use building)

Commissioner Johnson expressed concern that designating the mixed-use building as historic could limit future development options for the property owner. Commissioner Rodriguez countered that preserving the building's unique architecture would be beneficial to the neighborhood.

The commission also discussed proposed changes to the city's historic district guidelines, which were met with some opposition from a local business owner who felt the changes would be too restrictive.

* **Proposed Changes:** Revised guidelines would require owners of historic properties to obtain approval for any exterior modifications
* **Business Owner Concerns:** Fear that the new guidelines would lead to increased bureaucracy and costs for property owners

The commission will take up the discussion on the revised guidelines at their next meeting.
