* **New Building Permits**: A new proposal for a 5-story apartment building in the Lowertown area was presented. Some commission members expressed concerns about the building's design and potential impact on the neighborhood's historic character. The proposal will be further discussed at the next meeting.

A notable discussion took place regarding the potential demolition of a historic building on University Avenue.

The issue will be revisited at the next meeting.
