**Location:** City Hall, Room 200

#### Summary
The meeting began with a review of the agenda, which included several items related to historic district designations and property alterations.

* The HPC discussed the proposal to designate the Summit Hill neighborhood as a historic district. The commission voted unanimously (5-0) to recommend the designation to the City Council.
* A developer presented plans for renovating a building in the Lowertown neighborhood, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The HPC asked the developer to revise their proposal to better align with the historic district's design guidelines.
* Commissioners discussed the issue of maintaining historic buildings' original character while still allowing owners to make necessary updates and repairs.

There was no significant controversy or disagreement during the meeting, but Commissioner Johnson expressed concerns about the potential impact of new development on the neighborhood's historic character. However, this discussion did not lead to any contentious votes.

The HPC will continue to monitor developments in these areas and provide recommendations to the City Council as needed.
