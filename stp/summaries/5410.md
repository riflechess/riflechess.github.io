#### Meeting Info
* Type: Housing & Redevelopment Authority (HRA) meeting
* Purpose: To discuss and vote on two resolutions related to conduit revenue bonds for charter schools

* Location: City of Saint Paul

#### Summary

The HRA meeting began with a public hearing on the first resolution, which authorized the issuance and sale of conduit school lease revenue refunding bonds. Commissioner Yang expressed her opposition to the vote, citing concerns about the impact on the St. Paul Public Schools district and the challenges they are facing. She suggested that more intentional conversations should be had between the city and the school district about funding requests.

The motion to close the public hearing and approve the resolution was passed with four in favor (including Commissioner Yang) and one opposed, being Commissioner Yang herself. This suggests that Commissioner Yang's concerns were not sufficient to sway the majority of the council members.

The second resolution, which authorized the issuance and sale of conduit charter school lease revenue refunding bonds for the Twin Cities Academy Project, was also discussed in a public hearing. Similar to the first resolution, Commissioner Yang expressed her opposition to this vote as well, citing concerns about the impact on the St. Paul Public Schools district.

The motion to close the public hearing and approve the second resolution was passed with four in favor (again including Commissioner Yang) and one opposed, being Commissioner Yang herself. It's worth noting that Commissioner Yang's comments were more subdued for this resolution, but she still expressed concerns about the impact on the school district.

The meeting concluded with a nod of appreciation from Chair Johnson to Commissioner Provatsky, who is leaving the HRA after his last meeting before being sworn in as the new representative for Ward 4. Commissioner Yang also spoke up to express her gratitude and admiration for Commissioner Provatsky's work on housing projects and affordability pieces during their time together on the council.

Overall, while there were some differing opinions expressed by Commissioner Yang about the impact of these funding requests on the St. Paul Public Schools district, the majority of the council members voted in favor of approving both resolutions.
