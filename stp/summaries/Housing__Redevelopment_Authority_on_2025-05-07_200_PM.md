#### Summary

The meeting started with the approval of minutes from the previous HRA meeting. The staff report SR 25-65 presented an update on tax increment financing, highlighting the total tax increments expected to be collected and the captured tax capacity.

Director Antogna presented proposed changes to the Minneapolis-St. Paul housing finance boards' 2026-2027 low-income housing tax credit procedural manual and qualified allocation plan citywide. The proposed changes aim to increase points for projects with mixed-use and transit accessibility, while removing some criteria to make proposals more financially viable.

Deputy Director McMahon presented Highland Bridge updates, including amendments to the minimum assessment agreement, redevelopment agreement, and TIF plan. These updates aim to incentivize development on the site by reducing holding costs and providing a binding commitment for three residential buildings with 447 housing units.

Commissioner Yang expressed concerns about the agreements being crafted under the assumption that the rent stabilization amendment would be approved today, which could lead to unofficial decisions about how this Council will take action. Commissioner Nacre shared similar sentiments, expressing disappointment in having to change agreements and questioning whether these changes would affect what's built on the site, public money invested, and private money invested compared to the original agreement.

The meeting concluded with a discussion of an introduction to LISC-CAT fund master participation agreement amendment citywide and an introduction to LISC-CAT funds participation for the acquisition of property at 964 through 968 Payne Avenue in district five, ward six.
