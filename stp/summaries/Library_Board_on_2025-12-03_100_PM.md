The meeting began with a presentation by the Library Director on the proposed 2026 budget. Key points include:

* Continued investment in digital services and e-book collections
* Establishment of a new community outreach program for underserved populations

Board members discussed concerns regarding the allocation of funds, with some expressing support for increased funding for local author events and others arguing that more resources should be devoted to STEM programs.

A contentious vote arose when a motion was proposed to allocate an additional $10,000 for children's literacy programs. The motion passed 5-2, with Board members Johnson and Rodriguez opposing due to concerns about the allocation of funds and potential duplication of services.

The meeting concluded with discussion on strategic planning for the library system, including goals for increased community engagement and partnerships with local organizations.
