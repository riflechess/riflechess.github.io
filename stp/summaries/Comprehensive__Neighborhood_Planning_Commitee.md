#### Summary

The Comprehensive Neighborhood Planning Committee met to discuss the city's comprehensive neighborhood planning process. The main topic of discussion was the proposal for a new community center in the Rondo neighborhood.

The proposal, led by Council Member Nacre (corrected from original text), outlined plans for a $2 million community center that would provide space for community events, programming, and services. The proposal also included a request for an additional $1 million to be allocated for community outreach and engagement efforts.

Council Member Rongitsch expressed concerns about the feasibility of the project, citing concerns about funding and the potential impact on local businesses. Council Member Nacre responded by highlighting the benefits of the community center, including increased community engagement and economic development opportunities.

The committee voted 6-2 in favor of moving forward with the proposal, with Council Members Rongitsch and Garcia voting against it. The next step will be for the proposal to go before the full City Council for consideration.
