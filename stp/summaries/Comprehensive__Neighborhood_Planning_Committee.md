#### Summary
The meeting began with an introduction by Council Member Jane Naecker (corrected translation from "Nacre") on the purpose of the Comprehensive Neighborhood Planning Committee. The main topics discussed were:

* **Redevelopment Plans for Lowertown**: The committee reviewed proposed plans for revitalizing the Lowertown neighborhood, including new housing developments and commercial spaces. While some members praised the potential economic benefits, others expressed concerns about gentrification and displacement of long-time residents.
* **Neighborhood Budget Allocations**: The committee discussed budget allocations for various neighborhood projects, with a focus on public safety initiatives and community programming. Council Member Tom Johnson proposed an additional $100,000 allocation for a new community center in the Payne-Phalen neighborhood, which was met with support from some members but raised concerns about funding priorities.
* **Public Safety Discussion**: Community members expressed concerns about crime rates in several neighborhoods, particularly around schools and parks. The committee discussed potential solutions, including increased police presence and community-based initiatives.

A contentious moment arose during the discussion on redevelopment plans for Lowertown, with Council Member Maria Vasquez arguing that the proposed plans would benefit wealthy developers at the expense of long-time residents. This led to a heated exchange between her and Council Member Jane Naecker, who countered that the plans aimed to revitalize the neighborhood while also providing affordable housing options.

The meeting concluded with no final decisions made on the redevelopment plans or budget allocations. The next meeting is scheduled for April 4th, where further discussion and potential votes are expected.
