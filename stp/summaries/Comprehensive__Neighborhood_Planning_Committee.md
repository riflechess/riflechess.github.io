**Meeting Type:** Comprehensive Neighborhood Planning Committee
**Purpose:** Review and discuss upcoming projects in Saint Paul neighborhoods
**Date/Time:** March 12, 2023, 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM

#### Summary
The meeting focused on several neighborhood planning initiatives. Key points include:

* The committee reviewed the proposed plan for the Summit-University area, which includes upgrades to pedestrian infrastructure and increased housing density.
* The West Side Housing Initiative was discussed, with a focus on preserving affordable housing options in the area.
* Committee members expressed concerns about gentrification and the potential displacement of long-term residents.

A contentious discussion arose regarding a proposed zoning change for the Payne-Phalen neighborhood. Some committee members argued that the change would lead to increased property values and revitalization, while others expressed concern that it would drive out existing businesses and residents. The vote on this proposal was ultimately tabled until the next meeting due to lack of consensus.

The committee also discussed a potential partnership with a local non-profit to develop affordable housing options in the Frogtown neighborhood.
