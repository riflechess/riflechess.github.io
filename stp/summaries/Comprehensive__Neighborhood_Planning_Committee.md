#### Meeting Info
**Meeting:** Comprehensive Neighborhood Planning Committee
**Date/Time:** March 12, 2023 at 6:00 PM
**Location:** City Hall, Council Chambers
**Purpose:** Discussion and potential vote on several planning proposals for the city of Saint Paul.

#### Summary

The meeting covered a range of topics related to neighborhood planning. Key points include:

* The proposed development of a new community center in the Payne-Phalen neighborhood was discussed. While there was some opposition from residents who expressed concerns about increased noise and traffic, the majority supported the proposal.
* A plan for improving lighting along Summit Avenue was presented, with a focus on increasing safety at night. This received unanimous support from committee members.
* A proposal to create a bike-share system in Saint Paul was tabled due to lack of funding details.
* The committee discussed potential zoning changes to allow for more affordable housing options.

A contentious point arose during the discussion of the community center development, with one resident expressing concerns about increased property values driving out long-time residents. However, this concern was largely mitigated by the presence of a representative from the developer who assured that the new center would prioritize affordability and community engagement.
