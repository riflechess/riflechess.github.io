The meeting was called to discuss the ongoing neighborhood planning efforts in various parts of Saint Paul.

#### Summary

The committee discussed the proposed redevelopment plan for the Nacre Avenue area. The plan aims to revitalize the commercial corridor by attracting new businesses and improving public spaces. However, some concerns were raised about the potential impact on existing small business owners and residents. One representative from the Nacre Avenue Merchants Association expressed worries that the increased foot traffic could lead to noise and safety issues.

A budget allocation of $500,000 was proposed for the plan's implementation. The funds will be used for infrastructure improvements, marketing, and community engagement efforts. A vote on the budget allocation was taken, with 12 members in favor and 2 opposed. The dissenting members expressed concerns about the lack of transparency in the planning process and the potential displacement of low-income residents.

The committee also discussed the proposed bike lane installation along Summit Avenue. While some members welcomed the idea as a safety measure and a way to promote sustainable transportation, others raised concerns about the impact on parking and traffic flow. A motion was made to table the discussion until further research is conducted on the potential effects of the bike lanes.

The next meeting will be held in two weeks to continue discussing these topics and other neighborhood planning initiatives.
