#### Summary
The meeting began with a presentation on the status of several neighborhood planning projects. Notable updates include:
* The Summit-University neighborhood plan is nearing completion, with a focus on affordable housing and community development.
* The Rondo neighborhood plan is still in its early stages, with discussions around transportation infrastructure and small business support.

A public comment period allowed residents to share their thoughts and concerns about the planning process. Several attendees expressed frustration with the lack of representation from specific neighborhoods and called for more transparent communication from city officials.

The committee also discussed potential zoning changes to accommodate growing demand for affordable housing. However, some members raised concerns about the impact on existing businesses and property values.

A contentious vote was taken regarding the allocation of funds for neighborhood planning initiatives. While the majority voted in favor of allocating $200,000 to support community development projects, one member dissented, citing concerns over wasteful spending.

The committee also discussed public safety measures, including a proposal to increase police presence in high-crime areas. Some attendees argued that this approach would only exacerbate existing issues with racial profiling and policing practices.

A final discussion centered on the city's plans for addressing homelessness, with some members advocating for more affordable housing options and others pushing for stricter enforcement of existing ordinances. The committee agreed to schedule a follow-up meeting to continue these conversations.
