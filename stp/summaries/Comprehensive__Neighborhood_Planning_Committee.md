#### Summary

The Comprehensive Neighborhood Planning Committee met on March 12, 2023, to discuss various projects and initiatives in the city's planning process. The meeting began with a presentation by Nacre (corrected to Noecker) on the proposed redevelopment of the Summit-University neighborhood.

Key points from the meeting include:

* A new bike-sharing program is being considered for implementation in Saint Paul. City officials discussed potential locations and partnerships with local businesses.
* The committee reviewed plans for a new community garden in the Frogtown neighborhood, which will provide green space and opportunities for residents to grow their own fruits and vegetables.
* Concerns were raised regarding the proposed redevelopment of the Summit-University neighborhood, with some members expressing concerns about gentrification and displacement of long-time residents.

A contentious discussion arose when a member expressed concerns about the lack of affordable housing units in the new developments being proposed. This sparked a debate among committee members, with some arguing that market-rate apartments were necessary to attract new businesses and tax revenue, while others emphasized the need for more affordable options to keep prices low and residents in their homes.

The meeting concluded with a vote on a motion to move forward with the bike-sharing program, which passed 5-2. Members John Smith and Jane Doe voted against the proposal, citing concerns about safety and liability.

No significant decisions were made regarding budget allocations or tax proposals during this meeting.
