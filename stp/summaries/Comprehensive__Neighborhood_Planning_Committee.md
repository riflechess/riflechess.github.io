#### Summary

The Comprehensive Neighborhood Planning Committee meeting covered several key topics. The main agenda item was the review of the Noecker Street Reconstruction project. The committee discussed potential road closures and construction timelines, with some members expressing concerns about traffic congestion in the area.

Another significant topic was the proposal for a new community garden in the Rondo neighborhood. The proposal has received support from local residents and organizations, but there were discussions about the feasibility of locating the garden on city-owned land.

A public comment period was held, during which several residents spoke out about issues related to public safety and crime prevention. One resident expressed concerns about a recent increase in break-ins in their neighborhood, while another suggested implementing a community watch program to improve visibility and deter crime.

The committee also discussed potential updates to the city's zoning ordinances, with some members advocating for changes to allow for more mixed-use development. However, others raised concerns about preserving single-family home neighborhoods and maintaining historic character in certain areas.

No formal votes were taken on these topics, but they will be revisited at future meetings. The next Comprehensive Neighborhood Planning Committee meeting is scheduled for April 14th, 2023.
