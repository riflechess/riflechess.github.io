#### Summary
The meeting covered several topics related to neighborhood planning in Saint Paul.

* The committee discussed the proposed development of a new community center in the Frogtown neighborhood. The proposal includes a budget allocation of $1 million for construction and $200,000 for programming. The plan was met with enthusiasm from some committee members, who praised its potential to provide a safe space for residents.
* However, not all committee members were supportive of the proposal. Some expressed concerns about the location and the potential impact on local businesses.

A contentious point arose when discussing the proposed budget allocation for the community center. Nacre [Noecker] argued that the allocation was too high and that funds could be better spent on other neighborhood priorities. Nacre suggested allocating a smaller amount of $600,000 for construction and using the remaining funds for other initiatives. This suggestion was met with opposition from some committee members who believed that the full allocation was necessary to ensure the project's success.

Despite the disagreement, the proposal was ultimately approved with the full budget allocation of $1 million for construction and $200,000 for programming. The vote was 5-2 in favor of approval, with Nacre and another member voting against it.

The meeting also touched on other topics, including a discussion about improving pedestrian safety along University Avenue. Committee members expressed concerns about the lack of bike lanes and sidewalks, particularly around intersections with high traffic volume. Suggestions were made to prioritize funding for infrastructure improvements in this area.

No concrete decisions or budget allocations were made regarding pedestrian safety initiatives during this meeting. The discussion is expected to continue at a future meeting.

Overall, while there was some disagreement over specific proposals, the meeting remained productive and focused on addressing pressing neighborhood planning concerns in Saint Paul.
