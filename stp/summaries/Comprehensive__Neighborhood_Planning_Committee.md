#### Summary
The Comprehensive Neighborhood Planning Committee held a public meeting to review and discuss the proposed comprehensive plan for Saint Paul's neighborhoods. The plan aims to address various issues such as housing affordability, transportation, and public safety.

Key decisions:

* **Housing Affordability:** The committee agreed to allocate $1 million in funding to support affordable housing initiatives.
* **Transportation:** A proposal to establish a city-wide bike-sharing program was tabled for further discussion.
* **Public Safety:** The committee expressed concerns about crime rates in certain neighborhoods and requested additional resources from the police department.

Notable moment of contention:
The allocation of funds for affordable housing sparked debate among committee members. Some argued that $1 million was insufficient, while others believed it was a good starting point. A motion to increase funding to $2 million failed by a vote of 6-4.

Residents spoke about concerns regarding gentrification and the need for more community engagement in planning decisions. The committee acknowledged these concerns and committed to hosting additional public meetings to gather feedback.
