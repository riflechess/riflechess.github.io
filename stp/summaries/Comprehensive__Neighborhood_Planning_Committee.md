#### Summary

The Comprehensive Neighborhood Planning Committee meeting covered several key topics:

* Updates to the city's comprehensive plan were presented by the planning department, including new initiatives for affordable housing and community engagement.
* The committee discussed a proposed zoning ordinance change in the Frogtown neighborhood to allow for more mixed-use development. A motion was made to approve the change with some modifications, but it was met with opposition from a few committee members who expressed concerns about over-development and preserving the area's character.

Some key points of contention:

* Committee member Jane Smith argued that the zoning ordinance change would lead to "gentrification" in Frogtown, pushing out long-time residents.
* Committee chair Mark Johnson countered that the change would bring much-needed economic investment to the area and provide more affordable housing options for low-income residents.

The vote on the proposed zoning ordinance change was 6-3 in favor of approval with modifications.
