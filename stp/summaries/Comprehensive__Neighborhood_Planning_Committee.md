#### Summary
The Comprehensive Neighborhood Planning Committee met to discuss the proposed update to the zoning code. Key points from the meeting include:

* The current zoning code has not been updated since 1996, leading to confusion and inconsistencies.
* Proposed changes aim to simplify and clarify zoning regulations, making it easier for developers and property owners to navigate.
* The committee reviewed and provided feedback on several key areas:
	+ Affordable housing: The proposal aims to incentivize developers to include affordable units in new construction projects.
	+ Mixed-use developments: Changes would allow for more flexible use of space, enabling a mix of residential, commercial, and community spaces.
	+ Green spaces: Updates would prioritize the creation of parks, gardens, and other green areas throughout the city.

However, not all attendees were pleased with the proposed changes. Some expressed concerns about:

* Over-reliance on market-driven development, which could lead to gentrification and displacement of long-time residents.
* Insufficient attention to affordable housing needs, particularly in low-income neighborhoods.
* Unclear implementation timelines and potential for increased costs.

The committee will continue to review and refine the proposed zoning code update before bringing it to a City Council vote.
