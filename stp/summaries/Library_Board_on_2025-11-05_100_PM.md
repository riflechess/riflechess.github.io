#### Summary

The Library Board meeting focused on discussing the renovation of the Rondo Community Library, which will temporarily relocate to the Hallie Q. Brown Community Center. The board discussed the timeline for the move, with a planned closure date in December and a reopening date in January 2026.

Alex Riley, Branch Manager at the Rondo Library, presented an update on the library's current operations and plans for the renovation. He explained that the library will continue to provide services and programs at Hallie Q. Brown, including collections, programming, and computer open labs. The library will also maintain a presence at the University and Dale location during construction.

The board discussed concerns about the impact of the closure on community members, particularly those who rely on the library for access to basic needs like restrooms and internet. Council Member Coleman asked if there was a targeted reopening date, while Council Member Bui expressed concern about the lack of planning for the return of services after renovation.

Director Hartman explained that a timeline for the renovation is being developed, but it is still uncertain due to the complexity of the project. He reassured the board and community members that the library will maintain communication throughout the process and provide updates on the reopening date as soon as possible.

The meeting concluded with an acknowledgement of the collaborative effort between the Library Board, Director Hartman, and staff in preparing for the renovation and relocation. The next steps include finalizing the lease agreement, completing minor renovations at Hallie Q. Brown, and providing regular updates to community members.

No contentious votes or major disagreements were reported during the meeting.
