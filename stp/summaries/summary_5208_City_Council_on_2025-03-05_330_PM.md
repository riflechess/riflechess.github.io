#### Meeting Info
**Meeting Title:** City Council on 2025-03-05 3:30 PM
**Description:** Live and Recorded Public meetings of City Council on 2025-03-05 3:30 PM for City of Saint Paul

#### Summary

The city council meeting began with a consent agenda, which was adopted without discussion. The next item was the oath-taking ceremony for assistant city attorneys, followed by two zoning appeals (ABZA 25-1 and ABZA 25-2) that were withdrawn due to lack of votes.

The main discussion of the day centered around Item 34, APC 25-1, which concerned an appeal by the University of St. Thomas regarding a condition in their conditional use permit (CUP). The condition in question required the removal of the Goodrich Avenue Drive, which allowed for limited deliveries and emergency access to the university's South Campus.

Several residents and university representatives testified on this item, with some arguing that the drive was essential for emergency services and others claiming it would lead to increased traffic congestion. Council members asked questions and discussed the issue, but no vote was taken due to a lack of quorum.

The meeting then moved on to several public hearing items related to ordinances amending chapters in the St. Paul Regional Water Services Code. Each item was laid over for one week until March 12th after Ms. Yang moved to close the public hearings and approve them without discussion.

#### Highlights

* **Public Safety:** The Goodrich Avenue Drive condition in the University of St. Thomas' CUP was a major point of contention, with some arguing it was essential for emergency services and others claiming it would lead to increased traffic congestion.
