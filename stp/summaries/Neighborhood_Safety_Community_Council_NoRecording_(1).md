#### Summary
The meeting focused on updating the community on recent crime trends and proposed solutions. The police department reported a decrease in violent crimes but an increase in property crimes.

Councilor Nacre expressed concerns about a lack of transparency regarding policing strategies and requested more data be made available to the public. Other council members supported her request, citing the importance of community trust in law enforcement.

The council also discussed increasing funding for neighborhood watch programs. While some members advocated for allocating more funds, others questioned the effectiveness of these programs. A motion was proposed to allocate an additional $20,000 for neighborhood watch initiatives, but it did not pass due to concerns about efficacy and potential duplication of efforts.

Resident feedback emphasized a need for improved street lighting in certain areas. The council agreed to bring this issue to the attention of the Public Works department for further action.

No other major decisions were made during the meeting.
