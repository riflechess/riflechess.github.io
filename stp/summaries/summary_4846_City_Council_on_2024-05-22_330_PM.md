#### Summary
The meeting began with the Pledge of Allegiance and a brief discussion on consent agenda items 1-16. The consent agenda was approved without opposition. Resolution 24-106, which granted a sound level variance for Skinner's Pub, was revised after public hearing feedback and approved in its amended form.

The Department of Public Works capital budget was amended to close out 2020 and 2021 projects (Resolution 24-71), and the Department of Parks and Recreation received funding transfers from the Twins Grant special fund (Resolutions 24-95 and 24-116). Resolution 24-117 approved a sound level variance for Kaving, while Resolution 24-119 approved one for Podium Sports Marketing.

The Office of Neighborhood Safety's budget was increased by $3,598,936 using accumulated fund balance (Resolution 24-121), but this item was laid over until June 5th at the request of Council Member Johnson. Finally, the legislative hearing consent agenda was approved without opposition.

The meeting concluded with a heartwarming moment as several high school students from St. Agnes and Highland Park Senior High Schools spoke about their favorite things about Saint Paul. The council members praised them for their civic participation and enthusiasm.

#### Highlights
* **Office of Neighborhood Safety Budget Increase**: Council Member Johnson expressed concerns about the lack of detailed information on the budget increase, leading to a request to lay over the item until June 5th.
* **Public Hearing Feedback**: Resolution 24-106 was revised after public hearing feedback from Skinner's Pub and approved in its amended form. This highlights the importance of community engagement and responsiveness to concerns raised during public hearings.

Note: The meeting transcript did not include any significant discussion or debate on pressing issues such as public safety, quality of life, failing infrastructure, or fiscal malfeasance. However, the approval of Resolution 24-121, which increased the Office of Neighborhood Safety's budget, may be seen as a positive step towards addressing community concerns about public safety.
