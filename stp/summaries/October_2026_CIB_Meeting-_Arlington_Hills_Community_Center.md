#### Summary

The CIB meeting covered several key topics:

* The committee approved a $1.2 million allocation for road repairs in the Summit-University neighborhood.
* A proposal to install security cameras in high-crime areas was tabled until further discussion at the next meeting.
* The city's community development block grant funding was discussed, with a focus on supporting affordable housing initiatives.
* Public safety concerns were raised by several residents, including issues with crime in the Frogtown neighborhood.

A contentious issue arose during the discussion of the city's budget proposals. Committee member and City Councilor Rebecca Noecker expressed concern over the proposed allocation of $500,000 for a new downtown events center, arguing that it was not a priority at this time. This led to a 4-3 vote in favor of approving the proposal, with several members expressing reservations about the project's cost and potential impact on existing community programs.

Regarding public safety concerns, Mayor Melvin Carter assured residents that the city is taking steps to address crime in high-crime areas, including increasing police presence and implementing new community policing initiatives. However, some attendees expressed frustration at what they perceived as a lack of urgency from the city in addressing these issues.
