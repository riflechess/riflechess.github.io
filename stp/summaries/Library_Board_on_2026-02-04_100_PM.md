#### Summary

The Library Board meeting covered several topics related to the Transforming Libraries project. The first item on the agenda was the approval of minutes from January 14th, which was approved with some discussion about issues with the minutes.

The staff report provided an update on the progress of the Transforming Libraries project, including the Hamlin Midway and Hayden Heights libraries. The Director of Library Services highlighted the excitement around these projects, which aim to transform libraries into community hubs that provide safe spaces for people to gather, learn, and connect. Some of the notable features include:

* **Hamlin Midway:** A new construction project with a projected completion date of late 2026.
* **Hayden Heights:** A renovation project with a design and construction process underway, aiming for a spring start and a quarter-four 2027 opening.

The report also touched on the importance of technology-rich spaces and play and learn areas across all library locations. The staff is working to upgrade existing facilities, adding accessibility features like hearing loops and soundproofing, as well as incorporating new technologies such as hybrid meeting rooms and virtual collaboration tools.

Council Members Rieng and Kim expressed their support for the project, with Council Member Rieng noting that this project will have a significant impact on many communities, particularly those in the east side. They also acknowledged the challenges facing the Riverview library renovation due to a funding gap, but expressed confidence in securing additional funds through various channels.

The meeting concluded with a discussion of the Read Brave book launch and event, which took place last week. The Director of Library Services highlighted the importance of this program in promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion by selecting stories that reflect the experiences of immigrants.
