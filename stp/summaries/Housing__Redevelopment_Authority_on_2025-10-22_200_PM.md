#### Summary

**Item 1: New Dwelling Toolkit Presentation**
The HRA reviewed a newly completed toolkit designed to help property owners plan, design, and build additional housing units on their properties. The toolkit is intended to simplify the process for adding ADUs (accessory dwelling units) or principal units in specific zoning districts. Commissioners expressed enthusiasm for the tool and its potential to increase affordable housing options.

**Item 2: Authorization to Release 4-D Affordable Housing Incentive Program Covenant**
The HRA discussed releasing a restrictive covenant on a property located at 1048 Central Avenue West, allowing the buyer (St. Peter Claver Church) to demolish or repurpose the building for early education and expansion of their school space. Commissioners unanimously supported the request, citing the benefits of expanding early childhood education opportunities.

**Item 3: Resolution Endorsing Amendments to Minneapolis-St. Paul Housing Finance Board's Qualified Allocation Plan**
The HRA reviewed proposed amendments to the Qualified Allocation Plan (QAP), which would allow for increased capacity to support additional housing development in the city. The changes include reducing the minimum tax-exempt bond amount and prioritizing downtown office-to-housing conversion projects. Commissioners debated the proposal, with some expressing concerns about the impact on affordable housing supply and others supporting the creative approach.

**Item 4: PED Budget Update, Transfers Detail**
The HRA reviewed a budget update detailing transfers from the HRA to other city departments, including OFE (Office of Financial Empowerment), DSI (Department of Safety and Inspection), and the Mayor's Office. The discussion highlighted potential areas for strategic decision-making in future budgets.

Key takeaways:

* The new dwelling toolkit is an innovative tool that can increase affordable housing options.
* Releasing the 4-D covenant will support early childhood education expansion at St. Peter Claver Church.
* Proposed amendments to the QAP may impact affordable housing supply and require further consideration.
* Budget transfers between departments warrant review for potential strategic decision-making opportunities.
