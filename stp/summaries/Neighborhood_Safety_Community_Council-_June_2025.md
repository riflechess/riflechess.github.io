#### Summary

The Neighborhood Safety Community Council meeting was attended by representatives from various city departments, local businesses, and community members. The main topics of discussion were public safety concerns, crime prevention strategies, and community engagement.

One of the key discussions centered around the recent increase in property crimes in the Highland Park neighborhood. Council members expressed concern over the lack of transparency in reporting crime statistics and requested more detailed information on the measures being taken to address this issue. The Chief of Police assured the council that his department is working closely with local law enforcement agencies to improve communication and response times.

The council also discussed a proposal to establish a community-led neighborhood watch program in the Summit-University neighborhood. While some members expressed support for the idea, others raised concerns about the potential impact on community relations and the effectiveness of such programs. After some debate, the council voted 8-3 in favor of moving forward with the proposal, with conditions that the program be closely monitored and evaluated for its effectiveness.

Another topic of discussion was a request from local business owners to install additional streetlights in the downtown area. The council voted unanimously in support of this proposal, with an estimated budget allocation of $200,000 for the project.

Community members also raised concerns about noise levels and public gatherings in the Lowertown neighborhood. While there was no clear consensus on how to address these issues, the council agreed to establish a subcommittee to explore possible solutions.

The meeting concluded with a review of upcoming events and community engagement opportunities, including a summer safety fair and a series of town hall meetings scheduled for later this year.
