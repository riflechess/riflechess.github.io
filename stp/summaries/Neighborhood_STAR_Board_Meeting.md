#### Summary
The meeting covered various topics, including budget proposals, public safety initiatives, and business developments. A key discussion point was the proposal to allocate $100,000 from the Neighborhood STAR budget to support the development of a new community center in the Nellie Stone Johnson Community School area. This allocation was met with some opposition from board members who expressed concerns about the project's timeline and potential impact on existing community programs.

A separate proposal to implement additional street lighting in high-crime areas was also discussed, with some board members suggesting that the current lighting plan is adequate and that more targeted approaches are needed rather than a blanket increase in lighting. The vote on this proposal ended up being 5-3 in favor of moving forward with further research.

There was also discussion about ongoing efforts to support local businesses, including a potential partnership between the STAR Board and the City's Economic Development Agency to provide resources and training for small business owners.
