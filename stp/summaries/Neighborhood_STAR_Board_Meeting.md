#### Summary
The meeting began with an update from the Community Projects Committee. The STAR Board has allocated funds for a new community garden in the Summit-University neighborhood, which aims to provide green space and educational programs for local residents.

A budget update was presented by the Finance Committee, showing a balanced budget for the current fiscal year. However, there were some concerns raised about the allocation of funds for public safety initiatives. Council Member Nacre (Noecker) expressed concerns that not enough resources are being allocated to address gun violence in the city.

The Public Safety Committee presented data on crime rates and community policing efforts. The STAR Board discussed ways to increase police presence in high-crime areas, including implementing a new community-based policing program.

One of the most contentious topics was the proposal for a new bike lane on Snelling Avenue. Some residents expressed concerns about the potential impact on traffic flow and parking availability. After some debate, the STAR Board voted 7-3 to approve the proposal, with Council Members Nacre (Noecker), Jenkins, and Sanchez voting against it.

The meeting concluded with a discussion on upcoming community events, including a neighborhood clean-up initiative and a summer festival planned for June.
