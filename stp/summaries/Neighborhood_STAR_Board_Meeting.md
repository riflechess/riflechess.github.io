#### Summary

The meeting began with a brief update on the current projects funded by the STAR Board. The main agenda item was the proposal for a new community center in the Dayton's Bluff neighborhood.

A local resident expressed concerns about the potential noise and parking issues associated with the new community center. Several board members responded, highlighting the benefits of increased recreational activities and community engagement.

The board voted 7-2 to approve the funding allocation for the community center project, with Board Members Rodriguez and Lee opposing due to concerns about traffic congestion in the area.

Additionally, the STAR Board approved a resolution to support a local business initiative aimed at revitalizing the West 7th Street commercial corridor. This includes providing resources for small business owners and promoting economic development.

The board also received an update on the ongoing efforts to address homelessness in Saint Paul, including plans for new affordable housing units and social service programs.
