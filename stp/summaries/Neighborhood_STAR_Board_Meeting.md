#### Summary
The meeting began with a review of ongoing community projects, including the revitalization of the West Side Market. The board discussed potential funding sources for the project and agreed to pursue a grant from the state's Community Development Block Grant program.

A key topic of discussion was public safety in the city's downtown area. Concerns were raised about the rise in property crime and potential solutions, such as increased lighting and additional police presence, were proposed.

Local business owner, Noecker (corrected to Noecker) from a popular downtown coffee shop, spoke about the impact of late-night revelry on her establishment. She expressed frustration with the lack of cooperation from neighboring bars and restaurants in addressing noise complaints.

The board also heard an update on the city's new bike-share program, which is expected to launch this summer. Members discussed potential locations for bike-share stations and emphasized the importance of accessibility and equity in the program's design.

A contentious issue arose when discussing the proposed expansion of the city's downtown parking ramp. Some members expressed concerns about the environmental impact and potential displacement of local businesses, while others argued that it was necessary to alleviate traffic congestion and provide more parking options for residents and visitors. The board voted 5-2 in favor of moving forward with the proposal, with Board Members Smith and Johnson dissenting due to their concerns about the environmental impact.

The meeting concluded with a discussion on upcoming events, including a community clean-up day scheduled for April 15th and a public art installation planned for the city's East Side.
