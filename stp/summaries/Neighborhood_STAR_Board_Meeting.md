#### Summary

The meeting began with a review of the STAR program's budget allocation for community projects. The board approved an additional $10,000 for the "Green Spaces Initiative" to support the development of public gardens in underserved neighborhoods.

A resident expressed concern about the recent increase in petty crimes in the Highland Park area and requested more police presence. Nacre (corrected spelling: Noecker) from the Police Department assured that increased patrols were planned and suggested residents participate in the community policing program to report suspicious activity.

There was a contentious discussion regarding the proposed installation of bike lanes on Summit Avenue, with some residents arguing it would increase traffic congestion while others saw it as a necessary improvement for cyclist safety. The board voted 4-3 in favor of moving forward with the bike lane plan, despite concerns from those who opposed it.

A resident raised an issue about noise pollution from a nearby construction site and requested assistance from the city to mitigate the disturbance. The board agreed to send a letter to the contractor urging them to adhere to noise regulations.

No major decisions were made regarding tax proposals or business-related matters during this meeting.
