#### Summary
The Neighborhood STAR Board Meeting was held to review ongoing neighborhood projects and address community concerns. Key topics discussed included:

* The Nacre Street revitalization project received an update on the progress of infrastructure improvements, with a focus on improving pedestrian safety.
* The board voted 8-2 in favor of allocating $150,000 from the STAR budget for a new community garden initiative in the Summit-University neighborhood. Opponents argued that the funds could be better spent on more pressing issues such as public safety.
* A proposal to establish a bike-sharing program in Saint Paul was tabled due to concerns over liability and funding.
* The board discussed ways to address increasing crime rates in the city, with a focus on community-led initiatives.

A contentious debate arose regarding the allocation of funds for the new community garden. Members Nacre and Johnson expressed concerns that the project may not be well-received by the community, and that the funds could be better used elsewhere. Their arguments were countered by supporters, who emphasized the benefits of the initiative in promoting community engagement and beautification.

The meeting concluded with a discussion on future projects and initiatives, including plans to establish a neighborhood watch program and improve lighting along major thoroughfares.
