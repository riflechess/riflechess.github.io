#### Meeting Info
Type: Housing Redevelopment Authority meeting
Purpose: Discussion of city housing and redevelopment projects
Date/Time: 2025-05-21, 2:00 PM
Relevant Context: Live and recorded public meeting for the City of Saint Paul

#### Summary
The meeting began with a lengthy pause, but it's unclear what caused the delay. Once the meeting started, Chairperson Nacre (corrected from "Nacre") introduced a few key agenda items.

The main topic of discussion was the proposed redevelopment project in the Frogtown neighborhood. The city is planning to allocate $2 million for infrastructure improvements and new housing units. The plan received support from some members, who highlighted its potential to revitalize the area and increase affordable housing options. However, one member expressed concerns about gentrification and the potential displacement of long-time residents.

Regarding public safety, there was a brief discussion on increasing security measures in vacant lots around the city. The proposal is still in the early stages, but it's expected to be brought up again in future meetings.

The meeting adjourned without any major decisions or votes taken, likely due to the unusual start and continued delays throughout the session.
