title: Planning Commission Meeting - Canceled
date: 
---
It appears there is no meeting to summarize.

However, I can suggest an example of a summary based on a hypothetical Planning Commission Meeting:

#### Meeting Info
* **Meeting Type:** Planning Commission Meeting
* **Purpose:** Discuss and vote on zoning changes in the Highland Park neighborhood
* **Date/Time:** March 10, 2023, 6:00 PM
* **Location:** City Hall, Room 200

#### Summary
The meeting was attended by several residents of the Highland Park neighborhood who expressed concerns about a proposed zoning change that would allow for multi-family development on a currently single-family zoned property. The Planning Commission discussed the issue and heard from city staff regarding the benefits and drawbacks of the proposed change.

A key point of contention among commissioners was the potential impact on local traffic and parking. Some commissioners argued that the increased density would put additional strain on already congested streets, while others believed that the development would bring in much-needed revenue for the city.

The commission ultimately voted 5-2 to approve the zoning change, with Commissioners Rodriguez and Jensen dissenting due to concerns about traffic and parking.

Some key decisions made at the meeting include:

* Approving the zoning change
* Recommending additional traffic studies be conducted before construction begins
* Allocating $50,000 from the city's community development fund to support infrastructure improvements in the Highland Park neighborhood
