The Neighborhood Safety Community Council met to discuss ongoing concerns about property crime in the city. Council members reported an uptick in break-ins in the Dayton's Bluff neighborhood, with several residents sharing their own experiences of being targeted.

Noecker mentioned that the council had been working with the Saint Paul Police Department to increase patrols in high-crime areas, but expressed frustration that more hadn't been done to address the issue.
