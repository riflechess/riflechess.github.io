#### Summary
The Heritage Preservation Commission meeting covered several topics. The commission approved the minutes from the December 9th meeting after correcting a minor error. They then held a public hearing on a proposal to replace the front porch at 722 6th Street East in Dayton's Bluff. Commissioners raised concerns about the design of the new columns, with some suggesting that they be more historically accurate or consistent with the surrounding area.

The commission also reviewed and commented on the Metro Transit G Line, which will provide fast and reliable transit service in the Rice and Robert Street corridor of St. Paul. The HPC may give comments if they choose, but they will not take action or approve a resolution. No public comments were received on this item.

Regarding the Theodore Ham Brewing Company Historic District nomination for the National Register of Historic Places, several speakers testified in support of the nomination, including Ashley Bisner from J.B. Vang Partners and Paul Hart from the St. Paul Historic Preservation Political Committee. However, Sean Ryan from CLAP Investments opposed the nomination, citing concerns that it would fast-track financing and harm their businesses and investments at the site.

The commission ultimately voted to support the nomination, with all members present voting in favor. The next step will be for the State Historic Preservation Review Board to review the nomination on February 18th.
