#### Meeting Info
**Type:** Live and Recorded Public meeting
**Purpose:** Land Use Committee (LSAC) meeting to discuss zoning changes, variances, and other land use matters
**Date/Time:** April 9, 2026, [time not specified]
**Location:** Sun Ray Library, 2105 Wilson Ave, St. Paul, MN 55119

#### Summary
The LSAC meeting covered several topics related to zoning and land use in Saint Paul. Key decisions include:

* A variance request for a new apartment building on University Avenue was approved, with some conditions.
* The committee voted to recommend approval of a zoning change for the Rondo neighborhood, which will allow for more mixed-use development.
* A proposal to rezone a property on Randolph Avenue for a new restaurant was tabled due to concerns about parking and noise.

The most contentious issue of the evening was the variance request. Some committee members expressed concern that the building's design would not be in harmony with the surrounding neighborhood, while others argued that it met all necessary zoning requirements. The vote to approve the variance was 4-2, with two members voting against due to concerns about over-development.

Additionally, the meeting featured a public hearing on a proposed zoning text amendment related to short-term rentals. Several residents spoke out against the proposal, citing concerns about noise, parking, and property values. The committee voted to recommend approval of the amendment, but it will require further review by the City Council before becoming law.

Overall, the meeting was marked by some disagreement among committee members, particularly with regards to the variance request and short-term rentals. However, the majority of decisions were made with relative consensus.
