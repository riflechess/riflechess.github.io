#### Meeting Info
* **Meeting Type:** Housing & Redevelopment Authority (HRA) Public Meeting
* **Date/Time:** 2025-02-19, 2:00 PM
* **Purpose:** To discuss various items related to housing and redevelopment in the City of Saint Paul.

#### Summary

The meeting started with a motion to suspend certain items on the agenda. The first item was Resolution 25-310, which authorizes the city to designate F&C Development Inc. and Flaherty and Collins as tentative developers for the Central Station Block. Commissioner Nacre moved approval of the item, and it passed with six in favor and none opposed.

The second item was Resolution 25-309, which authorizes the city to enter into a cooperative funding agreement for Rice Street and Larpenter Avenue gateway alliance consulting services with the cities of Roseville and Maplewood. However, this item was withdrawn due to being an error on the agenda, as it is actually a City Council item.

The third item was highlights from the 2025 National Community Development Association (NCDA) conference. Deputy Director Nicole Green presented on behalf of the staff who attended the conference. She discussed the organization's benefits, such as providing legislative updates and action alerts, technical assistance, and discounted training opportunities for cities like Saint Paul. The staff also learned about regulatory updates, including a new rule for the Home Investment Partnerships Program.

Commissioner Bowies asked about partnerships between public and private sectors in community development. Deputy Director Green mentioned that there are examples of creative ways to partner with private agencies, and they can reach out to other cities to learn more.

The meeting concluded with Commissioner Nacre thanking the staff for their presentation and asking for continued updates on federal funding issues.

Overall, the meeting focused on housing and redevelopment-related items and the impact of federal budget uncertainties on Saint Paul's projects.
