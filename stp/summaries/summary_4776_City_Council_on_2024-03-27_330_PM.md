#### Summary
The meeting began with a brief introduction and roll call of council members. The first item on the agenda was Resolution 24-478, commemorating the observance of Ramadan 2024 and the significance to Muslims in St. Paul. Imam Hassan and community leaders spoke about the importance of recognizing and celebrating Ramadan, and the resolution was passed unanimously.

Next, the council heard a presentation from Chief Inks about Fire Captain Brittany Baker's historic promotion to Captain in the St. Paul Fire Department. The presentation included a reading of a poem written by Captain Baker, which spoke to her experiences as a black woman in the fire department and her desire to make change and be an inspiration to others.

The council then moved on to consider ordinance 24-5, amending chapter 63 of the legislative code pertaining to electric vehicle charging infrastructure in surface parking lots. Staff member Bill Dermody presented the proposed amendments, which would require developers to install EV-capable or EV-ready infrastructure in new or expanded surface parking facilities with more than 15 parking spaces.

The council also considered several resolutions related to budget and grant funding for the police department, including a $9,000 donation from the St. Paul Foundation and a $25,000 donation from the St. Paul Police Foundation.

Finally, the council held public hearings on several legislative hearing consent agenda items, including an appeal of a vacant building registration requirement at 1297 7th Street West. The owner of the property, Marlene Barrett, spoke about her concerns and asked for credit for back vacant house assessments to allow her to become current in all taxes.
