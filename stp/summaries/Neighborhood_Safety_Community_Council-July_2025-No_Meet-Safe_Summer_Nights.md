The meeting focused on the City of Saint Paul's Safe Summer Nights initiative, aiming to reduce crime and improve public safety during the summer months. Key discussion points included:

* **Crime Prevention Strategies**: Council members discussed strategies for addressing specific crime concerns, including:
