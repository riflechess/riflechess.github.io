**Purpose:** To discuss various city ordinances, resolutions, and other business matters.

#### Summary
The meeting covered several key topics. One significant decision was the approval of Resolution 25-1721, which amends project budgets to align with spending needs. The resolution involved transferring $40,000 from one project to another for library security purposes.

Another important discussion revolved around Ordinance 25-59, which updates traditional neighborhood districts to allow for more density and better design. Council members discussed the need for this ordinance and its benefits.

The council also approved a gun violence prevention ordinance (Ordinance 25-65), which aims to reduce the prevalence of assault rifles in the city. This was met with strong support from council members, who shared personal experiences related to gun violence and emphasized the importance of taking action to protect residents.

Additionally, the council discussed several other ordinances, including:

* Ordinance 25-72, amending chapters related to the Mississippi River Corridor Central Area, Critical Area, and Flood Plane Management Overlay Districts.
* Ordinance 25-63, allowing for garbage cart sharing at properties with two or more dwelling units.
* Ordinance 25-76, prohibiting the use and placement of virtual currency kiosks within the city.

The council also heard public testimony on various items, including resolution 25-253, which sets the solid waste service fee for 2026. Council members discussed a proposal to increase this fee but ultimately decided to keep it at the current rate.

One notable moment of contention arose during the discussion of Ordinance 25-76, which prohibits virtual currency kiosks. AARP representative Gordon Roble testified in support of regulating these kiosks due to concerns about fraud and consumer protection. However, a representative from Bitcoin Depot argued that a ban on kiosks would deprive residents of a legitimate financial service.

Council members moved several ordinances forward for further consideration, including Ordinance 25-72 and Ordinance 25-76. The meeting concluded with the council approving several resolutions and laying over other items for further discussion or action at future meetings.
