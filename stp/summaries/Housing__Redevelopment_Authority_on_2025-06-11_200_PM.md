#### Summary

The meeting began with a public hearing on Resolution 25-120, which approved a parking license agreement between the HRA and the Minnesota Department of Administration for parking spaces in the Lower Town parking ramp. The motion to close the public hearing was passed unanimously.

Next, the staff report on Item 2 introduced a request from 180 Degrees, Inc. for host approval for bank-qualified conduit revenue bonds to refinance a taxable loan for renovations at Brittany's Place. Director Jenny Wolfe explained that conduit revenue bonds are special obligations of a governmental issuer and allow nonprofits like 180 Degrees to access tax-exempt financing.

Commissioner Neaker asked why the city wouldn't issue the bonds itself, and Director Wolfe explained that the city doesn't typically issue bank-qualified bonds, but rather hosts them through other issuers. Commissioner Bowie asked for clarification on the process of host approval and how it differs from issuing the bonds themselves.

Dan Farr, President and CEO of 180 Degrees, explained the organization's use of conduit revenue bonds to refinance a loan at a lower interest rate. The city will provide host approval for the bonds, which will allow 180 Degrees to save tens of thousands of dollars in interest payments.

The staff report on Item 3 introduced a refinancing proposal for pledged parking bonds. Ginny Wolfe explained that the HRA owns 7,062 parking spaces in downtown St. Paul and has issued pledged parking revenue bonds over the years. The current principal balance of the prior bonds is $19,920,000, and the HRA proposes to issue new bonds to refinance the existing debt.

Commissioner Noecker asked why certain parking facilities were included in the pledge while others, such as the Lawson ramp, were not. Director Wolfe explained that the Lawson ramp still has debt on it from the original financing and that the goal is to size the facility's net operating income with the debt service.

The proposal will reduce the annual debt service payment to 1.3 million and extend the final maturity 10 years to 2045. The city will continue to pledge $3 million of meter and fine revenue, but this is only for credit enhancement and to allow for the lowest borrowing cost. The refinancing will be done through taxable bonds for the Robert Street ramp.

The next steps include approval by the HRA board and the City Council, as well as execution of documents related to the financing. The city will offer an offering document to the bond market, price the bonds, give notice to prior bondholders, and close on July 9th.

Commissioner Provatsky asked about the current debt service and new debt service, which Director Wolfe explained would be significantly reduced. Commissioner Noecker also asked questions and expressed appreciation for the team's work on this project.
