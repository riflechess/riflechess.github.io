#### Meeting Info
**Meeting Title:** City Council on 2025-07-09 3:30 PM
**Meeting Description:** Live and Recorded Public meetings of City Council on 2025-07-09 3:30 PM for City of Saint Paul

#### Summary
The meeting started with a congratulations to Councilmember Yang on the arrival of her new family member. The consent agenda, consisting of items 4 through 39, was approved without discussion. Resolution 25-1011, honoring Chris Taylor of Ecolab, was introduced and passed after Chris Taylor's representative thanked the council for the recognition.

The meeting then moved to discuss Ordinance 25-38, which would allow pedicabs to pull a trailer and operate during rush hour in Saint Paul. This ordinance is part of an effort to encourage vibrancy downtown and increase eco-friendly transportation options. A public hearing was held on this item, but no one testified against it.

The meeting also discussed several other items, including resolutions for the Department of Parks and Recreation grant fund and the police department's special fund budget donation from the St. Paul Police Foundation. These resolutions were all approved without opposition.

#### Highlights

**Supportive Housing Facility Zoning Appeal**
The council heard two appeals regarding zoning variances for supportive housing facilities. The first appeal, ABZA 25-3, concerned a facility at 418 Sherburn Avenue and was laid over to August 6th due to concerns about public safety and the impact on the neighborhood.

**Second Zoning Appeal**
The second appeal, ABZA 25-4, regarding a facility at 438 Daly Street, was also discussed. The council decided to deny the appeal, citing that there were no grounds to support it and that the findings for granting variances had not been met. However, Councilmember Johnson suggested that this issue requires a policy change.

**Consent Agenda**
Items 54 through 70 on the legislative hearing consent agenda were also approved without opposition.

#### Good News
Several pieces of good news were shared at the end of the meeting. These included:

* The Rice Street Library's program, Barnyard Buzz, returning on July 18th.
* A couple of fair housing workshops being hosted by the Greater Eastside District Council and the City of Saint Paul.
* The Highland District Council hosting Summer Thursday with a movie, food, and activities at Sibley Manor Apartments.
* An opportunity to honor the elder, Melvin Jowes, who passed away recently.
