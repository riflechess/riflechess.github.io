All of these items were laid over to July 16th for final adoption.

Item 44 was a public hearing for Resolution Public Hearing 25-124, which involved Hope Wedge, who spoke in favor of approving the assessment for sanitary sewer line repair on her property.

Items 45-48 were resolutions related to grant funds and sound-level variances for events. These items were all approved unanimously.

Item 49 was a public hearing regarding ABZA 25-3, an appeal by Dominic Harchetti to the Board of Zoning Appeals' decision denying his request for a variance to establish a 24-resident supportive housing facility on property at 418 Sherburn Avenue. The applicant spoke, presenting letters from neighbors in support and refuting staff's findings.

Council Member Bowie moved to lay over this item until August 6th, citing concerns about public safety and the need for further review of zoning laws regarding supportive housing.

Item 53 was another appeal by Mark Schwartz regarding a decision denying two variance requests to establish a 22-resident supportive housing facility on property at 438 Daly Street.

Other items on the agenda included legislative hearing consent agenda items 54-70, which were approved without public comment.

The meeting concluded with announcements of upcoming events and good news from around the wards.
