The meeting began with a tribute to Chief Inks, who was reappointed as the Fire Department chief. Council members expressed their appreciation for his leadership and service. 

Next, the staff report discussed the 2025 legislative session, covering various topics such as budgeting, taxation, and public safety. Bryn House, the Intergovernmental Relations Director, provided a detailed report on the city's efforts and outcomes during the session. Key points included:

Council members provided feedback on the report, expressing frustration with the cannabis aid being eliminated and the lack of progress on downtown revitalization. They also discussed the importance of prioritizing their legislative agenda and working more closely with state legislators to ensure success in future sessions.

The meeting continued with a discussion on various ordinances, including one that would allow pedicabs to pull trailers and another that would establish classifications for legislative hearing officers. A public hearing was held on a rezoning application for the Hams Brewery site, with both supporters and opponents presenting their arguments.

Council members voted in favor of the motion for intent to approve the rezoning request, with some expressing concerns about parking and business impact. The item will be discussed further at three additional council meetings.

The meeting concluded with a public hearing on an appeal related to supportive housing facilities, where the applicant requested a variance to operate 11 residents' facility within a quarter mile of other similar facilities.
