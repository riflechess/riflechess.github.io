#### Summary
The meeting began with a presentation by the St. Paul Children's Collaborative on their data-driven approach to improving outcomes for young people in the city. The collaborative presented data on various indicators, including kindergarten readiness, third-grade reading proficiency, and high school graduation rates. The data showed significant disparities between different racial and ethnic groups, with students of color facing particular challenges.

The presentation also highlighted the importance of addressing poverty and access to health care as underlying factors contributing to these disparities. The collaborative emphasized their commitment to using data to drive grant-making decisions and ensure that resources are targeted towards areas of greatest need.

Council members asked questions about the methodology behind the data, including the definition of trauma used in the ACEs scale. They also expressed concerns about the lack of nuance in racial and ethnic categories and the potential for biases in survey questions.

The meeting then shifted to a discussion on potential topics for the Audit Committee's next study. The committee is considering two options: revisiting the housing development process or examining the data practices process. Members discussed the pros and cons of each option, with some expressing support for prioritizing the data practices process due to its pressing nature and potential for quick results.

Council President Nacre noted that both topics are important and that the Audit Committee can conduct multiple audits simultaneously. The committee ultimately decided to prioritize the data practices process for now, with a plan to revisit the housing development process in conjunction with other studies.
