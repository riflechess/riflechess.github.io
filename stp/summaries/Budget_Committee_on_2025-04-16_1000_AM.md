#### Summary

The Budget Committee met to discuss labor relations, collective bargaining agreements, and civil service rules in Saint Paul. Jason Schmidt presented on the city's complex labor relations environment, with 25 unions organized into 22 contracts and a unionization rate of approximately 98%. The committee discussed the process for negotiating collective bargaining agreements, which can take several months or even years to complete.

Council members asked questions about the differences between "trades" and "traditional" unions, as well as the process for interest arbitration. Jason Schmidt explained that interest arbitration is a last resort when negotiations fail, and that an outside arbitrator makes a binding decision on contract terms.

The committee also discussed the city's civil service rules, which date back to 1914. The current system is seen as outdated, and changes are being proposed to make it more responsive to the modern labor market. Jason Schmidt noted that any changes to the civil service rules will need to be approved by the City Council.

Several council members expressed interest in having more information about contract negotiations and collective bargaining agreements, particularly regarding budget implications and timelines for upcoming negotiations. Jason Schmidt offered to provide a document outlining the status of each individual contract and the timeline for upcoming negotiations.

The committee also discussed the importance of collaboration between the City Council and labor relations staff during the negotiation process, including briefings and information sharing. Council members emphasized their desire to be informed and engaged throughout the process, particularly regarding budget implications and potential changes to civil service rules.
