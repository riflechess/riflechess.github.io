#### Summary

The meeting started with a brief introduction by Chair Jost, welcoming new board member Council Member Coleman. The first item on the agenda was the approval of minutes from August 6, 2025, which was approved unanimously.

Next, Director Hartman presented the 2026 library budget proposal, highlighting changes from 2025, including:

* Eliminating 1.3 FTE (0.8 in public services and 0.5 in maintenance)
* Repurposing 1.0 FTE to be vacant
* Reducing library materials budget
* Decreasing substitute staffing budget
* Increasing attrition rate
* Eliminating read brave budget from general fund, shifting it to special funds

Council Member Yang asked about the impact of reducing library hours at Arlington Hills library, and Director Hartman explained that this was due to the loss of 0.8 FTE in public services.

Council Member Johnson expressed opposition to reducing library hours, citing concerns about community needs and values. Chair Jost clarified that the decision to reduce hours was made based on data and consideration for least impact on staff and the public.

Director Hartman also presented information on contracted security, safety materials, and opioid settlement funding. Council Member Bowie asked about staffing changes at Rondo library, which Director Hartman explained would involve temporary reassignment of staff from other libraries.

The meeting then shifted to a discussion of special funds, including fund 211, which is used for library safety specialists and modernization projects. Council Member Johnson expressed concerns about relying on special funds for ongoing expenses and requested more information on how this will be addressed in the future.

Council Member Noecker asked about the current library fund balance, which Chair Jost said would be provided later. Council Member Johnson discussed the challenge of funding library materials and requested more information on strategies to address this issue.

The meeting concluded with a discussion of the Hamlin Midway library opening in 2026 and potential staffing needs for that location. Chair Jost thanked Director Hartman and staff for their presentation and expressed appreciation for the thoughtful questions from board members.
