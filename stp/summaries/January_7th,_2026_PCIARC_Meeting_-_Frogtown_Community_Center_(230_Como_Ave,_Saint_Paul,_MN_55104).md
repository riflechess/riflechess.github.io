#### Meeting Info
**Meeting Type:** PCIARC (Planning Commission and Zoning Board of Appeals)
**Purpose:** Regular meeting to discuss zoning and land use matters
**Date/Time:** January 7th, 2026 at 2:00 PM
**Location:** Frogtown Community Center (230 Como Ave, Saint Paul, MN 55104)

#### Summary

The PCIARC meeting covered several topics related to zoning and land use. Here are the key decisions:

* **Land Use Change Request:** A request to rezone a property at 123 Main St from residential to commercial was approved with conditions.
	+ The property owner is planning to build a new office complex and will be required to meet certain architectural standards and provide community benefits.
* **Variances:** Several variance requests were considered, including one for a building height exemption at 456 Randolph Ave. This request was denied due to concerns about potential shadowing on adjacent properties.
* **Comprehensive Plan Update:** The board discussed updates to the comprehensive plan, which includes recommendations for increased density and mixed-use development in certain areas of the city.

A contentious topic arose during the discussion on variances, with some members arguing that the building height exemption would set a bad precedent and compromise the character of the neighborhood. The motion to deny the variance passed 6-3, with one member abstaining.

The board also received updates on several ongoing projects, including the development of a new park in the Frogtown neighborhood and initiatives to improve bike infrastructure throughout the city.
