#### Summary

The meeting began with the approval of minutes from September 10th, 2025. The first agenda item was Resolution Public Hearing 25-221, amending the 2025 financing and spending plans in the library agency special projects. Director Hartman explained that the Friends of the St. Paul Public Library have additional funds to transfer to the library before the end of the year for transforming libraries and youth and family services programs.

The main topic of discussion was the Library Materials Update, presented by Josh Schaefer and Jessica Zilhart. They reported on the challenges of maintaining a digital collection due to increasing prices and licensing agreements with publishers. The cost of e-books and e-audiobooks is significantly higher for libraries than for individual consumers, making it challenging to meet demand.

Council members discussed the trend towards digital materials and the stabilization point in circulation numbers. Some expressed concern about the potential impact of budget reductions on the collection's robustness, wait times, and relevance to the community. The librarian presented data on the types of materials most used by patrons, including e-books and e-audiobooks.

Council President Kim raised a question about demographics, asking if there was data on who uses digital content. Jessica Zilhart responded that they don't collect demographic information on library card holders, but Library Go usage might indicate younger users are accessing digital content.

The meeting concluded with a discussion on how other libraries are dealing with the move to digital and increasing costs. Jessica mentioned that some libraries have tried different purchasing strategies, such as DRM-free collections, but these have been met with challenges from publishers.

No formal votes or decisions were made during the meeting. The next steps will be to consider the implications of budget reductions on the library's collection and services, and potentially explore innovative solutions to address the challenges of digital content pricing and licensing agreements.
