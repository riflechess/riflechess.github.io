#### Summary

The meeting began with introductions of the new members, including Noah McVeigh and Soria (who will be staffing the committee). The Chair thanked everyone for their participation and apologized for not having a roll call list.

The discussion focused on selecting the next topic for audit. Mr. Noecker proposed that the committee align its work with the city council's interests and have more interaction with the council in choosing topics. He suggested reviewing past ideas, including those from internal staff surveys and external community surveys, as well as any new ideas.

Several members shared their thoughts on potential topics, including:

* Mr. McVeigh proposed an enterprise risk assessment for the city
* Ms. Dilworth mentioned the chief budget officer and joint powers agreement
* Mr. Lastow suggested looking at data requests related to the Data Practices Act
* Council President Noecker suggested examining the housing development process from start to finish

The committee discussed risks associated with various topics, including compliance with the Data Practices Act, employee retention and turnover, and sidewalks.

After considering all the suggestions, the committee decided to forward two topics to the city council for a final vote: data practices and housing development process. They agreed to apply the risk assessment rubric to these topics before presenting them to the council.

The meeting concluded with a brief update on community engagement from Mr. Farnsworth and an announcement that the contract with Wilder has been renewed after positive feedback from committee members.
