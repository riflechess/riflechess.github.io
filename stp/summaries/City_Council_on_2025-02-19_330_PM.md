#### Summary

The city council meeting began with the adoption of the consent agenda, which included a resolution authorizing the city to enter into a cooperative funding agreement for the Rice Street and Larmander Avenue Gateway Alliance Consulting Services. Vice President Kim highlighted the partnership's success in revitalizing the area, citing improved public safety and community engagement.

Next, the council honored Frank White for his contributions to African American history and culture in St. Paul. Council Member Bowie presented a resolution recognizing White's efforts and acknowledged the impact of his work on preserving historical landmarks and legacies.

The meeting also addressed two zoning appeals, ABZA 25-1 and ABZA 25-2, which involved variances for mixed-use developments at Highland Bridge. Councilor Jost presented arguments in favor of granting the appeals, citing evidence of errors in fact-finding and procedure by the Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA). However, a roll-call vote resulted in a tie, with three council members voting in favor and three opposed.

In other business, the council approved ordinances for rezoning properties at 25 George St. East and 642 Selby Avenue, as well as adopting an ordinance amending Chapter 2.02 of the Administrative Code to add Section G10, establishing an Office of Financial Services grants section. The meeting concluded with a discussion on legislative hearing consent agenda items and announcements from council members about upcoming events in their wards.

Notable disagreements arose during the discussion on ABZA 25-1, where Council Members Kim, Yang, and Nacre voted against granting the appeal due to concerns about practical difficulties and the BZA's decision-making process.
