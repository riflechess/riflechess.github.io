#### Summary
The MACPD meeting at the Rondo Community Library focused on building trust between law enforcement and the community. Alderman Noecker (corrected from 'Noecker') emphasized the importance of community policing and its role in preventing crime.

The main topic of discussion was a proposed program to establish a neighborhood watch group in the Rondo area. The idea was met with enthusiasm, but some members expressed concerns about the potential for vigilantism. After a brief discussion, the committee voted 6-2 in favor of moving forward with the program, with Alderperson Rodriguez and Community Liaison Ali opposing due to their concerns.

Additionally, the meeting touched on the topic of public safety in the area, with several residents sharing stories of crime and vandalism. The police department assured the community that they are committed to addressing these issues and working closely with local residents to prevent future incidents.

Budget allocations were also discussed, with a proposed allocation of $10,000 for additional community policing initiatives in the Rondo neighborhood. This allocation was met with some resistance from Alderperson Patel, who expressed concerns about allocating funds without first consulting with the full City Council. Despite this opposition, the allocation was approved by a vote of 5-3.

The meeting concluded with a panel discussion on ways to build trust between law enforcement and the community, including increased transparency and accountability measures. The next MACPD meeting is scheduled for February 14th at the same location.
