#### Meeting Info
**Meeting Type:** Housing and Redevelopment Authority (HRA) Meeting
**Date/Time:** January 22, 2025, 2:00 PM
**Description:** Live and Recorded Public meeting of Housing & Redevelopment Authority for the City of Saint Paul.

#### Summary

The HRA meeting focused on discussing HRA-owned properties, their potential uses, and the process for disposing of them. Director Newton introduced Melanie McMahon, who presented an overview of the 200 parcels of land owned by the HRA across various wards in Saint Paul. 

McMahon highlighted that each parcel has unique characteristics and constraints, such as environmental reviews, long-term leases, or specific requirements from funding sources. She provided examples of redeveloped properties, including single-family homes, multifamily buildings, and commercial developments.

The discussion centered on the two main ways to dispose of HRA-owned properties: Request for Proposals (RFP) and direct third-party inquiries. The RFP process involves advertising proposals for specific sites, while direct inquiries allow interested parties to submit a proposal directly to the HRA.

Commissioner Yang asked about the process for initiating an RFP and how staff determines which parcels to prioritize. Director Newton explained that RFPs can be initiated through various means, including community requests or developer interest. However, there have been constraints on resources and policy requirements favoring affordable housing development.

The discussion also touched on transparency and communication with stakeholders. The HRA agreed to provide a list of addresses for each parcel, allowing commissioners to identify which parcels are of interest and priority in their wards.

Regarding parking ramps, the HRA owns approximately 7,200 parking spaces across various downtown locations. An RFP was issued last year to replace equipment using ARPA funds, with the replacement expected this year.

The meeting concluded with discussions on follow-up actions, including individual meetings with board members to review developable parcels within their wards and exploring ways to dispose of non-developable parcels.
