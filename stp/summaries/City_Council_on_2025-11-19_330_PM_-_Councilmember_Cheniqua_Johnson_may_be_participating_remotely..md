#### Summary

The meeting began with a discussion on the consent agenda, where several items were passed without debate. The council then moved on to discuss and pass ordinances related to public safety, quality of life, and business development.

One notable item was Ordinance 25-78, which establishes structured quarterly reporting requirements for certain personnel vacancies and overtime utilization in city departments. The ordinance is intended to provide more transparency and accountability in the city's budgeting process. However, there were some concerns raised by Council Member Johnson about the timeline for implementing this requirement.

Another significant item was Resolution 25-232, which amends the City's Capital Improvement Budget and Operating Budget to correct a bond proceed transfer for firefighters' cardiac monitors. This resolution was passed without debate.

The council also held public hearings on several items, including Ordinance 25-72, which pertains to the Mississippi River Corridor Critical Area (MRCCA) ordinance. Several speakers testified on this item, expressing concerns about the height restrictions and bird-safe glass requirements in the proposed ordinance. The public hearing was continued until December 3rd for final adoption or introduction of amendments.

The Port Authority's budget presentation was also given by President Hurley, who outlined several projects and initiatives currently underway. He requested a $250,000 increase to the port's mandatory levy, which would be used to support operational expenses and hire additional staff.

In the legislative hearing section, Council Member Bowie pulled Item 35, RLH RR 25-28, ordering the rehabilitation or removal of structures at 430 Dale Street North. This item was discussed in detail, with several speakers testifying on behalf of the Islamic Center that occupies the property. After a lengthy discussion, Council Member Bowie moved to amend the language to order an inspection by December 15th and lay over until December 17th.

The meeting concluded with several good news items being shared, including a free food and local resource event hosted by the East Side Environmental Justice Group and a baby shower for Council Member Johnson.
