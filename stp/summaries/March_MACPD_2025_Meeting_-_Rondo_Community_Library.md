#### Summary
The meeting began with a brief update on the progress of the Rondo Community Land Trust's affordable housing project. The developer reported that they are on track to meet their deadlines and expect to break ground within the next few months.

The main topic of discussion was the proposed plan for improving public safety in the area. A representative from the Saint Paul Police Department presented a report highlighting areas of concern, such as crime hotspots and pedestrian safety. The police officer suggested installing additional lighting and security cameras along Midwest Avenue.

There was some debate among attendees regarding the effectiveness of increased security measures. One resident expressed concerns about the potential for over-policing and its impact on the community. Another attendee argued that more visible policing would actually help deter crime. The discussion remained civil, but it was clear that opinions were divided on this issue.

The meeting also included a report from the City's transportation department regarding upcoming road construction projects in the area. A brief presentation highlighted the planned improvements to local bus routes and bike lanes.

The attendees voted unanimously to support the proposed plan for improving public safety, with some reservations about the potential impact on community relations.

One notable point of contention was a request by a local business owner to reconsider the zoning regulations for a nearby vacant lot. The owner argued that the current restrictions would prevent them from opening a much-needed retail space in the area. After some discussion, the MACPD decided to table this issue until their next meeting to allow for further research and community input.

Overall, the meeting provided an opportunity for residents, business owners, and city officials to come together and address pressing issues in the Midwest Avenue area.
