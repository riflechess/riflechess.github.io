The meeting covered several agenda items related to city ordinances, zoning changes, and property management. Notable decisions include:

* Ordinance 24-40 was adopted, amending Section 220.05 of the Legislative Code to set rates for base-level garbage service effective April 1st, 2025.
* The first reading of Ordinance 25-2 was laid over to January 15th for second reading and public hearing. This ordinance aims to complete a charter change by allowing administrative citations as a tool for upholding equity in the city.
* Macalester College's application to rezone property at 1655 and 1661 Grand Avenue and 37 Macalester Street was laid over to January 15th for second reading and public hearing.

The council also discussed several contentious issues:

* A vacant building assessment case involving Mr. Novak, who is facing significant fees due to the vacant building program. Council Member Bowie proposed extending the payment plan to seven years and providing additional resources to help Mr. Novak.
* An appeal of an order to vacate a property at 722 East 6th Street was discussed. The legislative hearing officer recommended denying the appeal, but Mr. Azazi argued that the property could be brought up to code compliance within 30 days.

The meeting concluded with a lighthearted moment as Council President Jalali announced the arrival of baby Henry Muamu Hernandez, the first future junior member of the city council family.
