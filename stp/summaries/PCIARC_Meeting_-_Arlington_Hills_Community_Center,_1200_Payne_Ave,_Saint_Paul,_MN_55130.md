#### Summary

The meeting began with approval of the agenda and minutes. The chair reported on attending a NAACP meeting where data was presented for the city, and Commander Jacob was scheduled to present some of that data tonight.

Commander Jacob presented traffic stop data for 2024, showing an increase of about 4,000 stops compared to 2023. He also showed demographics by race and gender for those stopped. Some attendees asked questions about the data, including whether it could be filtered to show specific types of enforcement actions, such as "bogus" enforcement emails.

The discussion then turned to use of force data, with Commander Jacob presenting numbers showing a reduction in use of force incidents compared to 2023. He explained that the majority of these incidents were soft empty hand techniques, which are low-level methods used by officers to control individuals.

Some attendees asked questions about the comparison to national or regional data, and Commander Jacob noted that while he did not have direct comparisons, his department had implemented additional deescalation training and response to aggression training in recent years, leading to a 37% reduction in use of force incidents since 2014.

The meeting also included updates from other departments, including the hero department. Commissioner Bruce asked questions about the disproportionality of black residents experiencing youth workforce compared to white residents, and Deputy Director Cam responded that it was a complex issue with both socioeconomic and racial factors at play.

Some attendees expressed interest in seeing statistics on communication barriers and mental health calls, which the SPPD director agreed to look into. The meeting adjourned after 10 minutes for a closed-door session.
