#### Summary
The meeting covered several topics related to community development in the Arlington Hills neighborhood. Notable discussions included:

* The proposal for a new community garden on the corner of Arcade Street and Payne Avenue. The proposal was met with enthusiasm from residents who see it as an opportunity to beautify the area and promote sustainability. However, some concerns were raised about the potential impact on local parking.
* A discussion on improving street lighting in the neighborhood, particularly along Arcade Street. Residents reported instances of car break-ins and other safety concerns due to inadequate lighting. The city agreed to install new lights and increase maintenance frequency.
* A request from a local business owner for assistance with revitalizing the commercial area on Payne Avenue. PCIARC members discussed possible initiatives, such as facade grants and marketing efforts, to support small businesses in the neighborhood.

The proposal for the community garden was approved with conditions to address parking concerns. The street lighting improvement plan is expected to begin soon, pending completion of an environmental assessment.
