#### Summary
The meeting began with Coordinator Cumberland sharing updates on the PCR. Four new commissioner appointments were recommended to Mayor Carter, and three reappointments were also submitted for consideration. The coordinator also shared a brief new policy regarding PODPA (Peace Officer Discipline Procedures Act) complaints, which will be sent to commissioners and IA18 for review.

The meeting touched on 2024 complaint data, with eight complaints in the withdrawn category. Two of these complaints were withdrawn after speaking with a supervisor, while two others were forwarded to a supervisor. One complaint was not cooperative with providing information during the investigation, and one was withdrawn at the complainant's request.

In terms of departmental updates, Deputy Director of Commerce discussed budget cuts from last year's cycle and the department's plan to absorb these cuts through salary savings and new hires. The department is hiring a labor standards one investigator and a buyer position, and will have six months' worth of salary savings from the June or July start date.

The meeting concluded with no further business for the public portion, and reconvened after two minutes for the closed portion (not summarized here).
