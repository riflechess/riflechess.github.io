#### Summary
The meeting consisted of various items on the agenda, but the main focus was on two items: ABZA 25-1 (appeal by Sean Ryan, Ryan Companies, U.S. Inc.) and APC 25-1 (appeal by the University of St. Thomas). Both items were related to conditional use permits (CUP) and zoning appeals.

For ABZA 25-1, Ms. Jost explained that the council did not have enough votes to take action on the item, so it was withdrawn per Minnesota Statute 1599. This means that if no action is taken by the city administrative review period of 60 days (March 17th), the application will be approved by operation of law.

For APC 25-1, the University of St. Thomas appealed the Planning Commission's decision to uphold Condition 16 in its current state, which requires the removal of a driveway on Goodrich Avenue that provides access to the university's South Campus. Several speakers testified during the public hearing, including representatives from the university and neighbors.

The speakers presented various arguments for and against modifying the conditional use permit (CUP) to allow the Goodrich Avenue drive to remain in place. Some argued that removing the driveway would compromise safety and emergency access, while others believed that it was unnecessary and could lead to traffic congestion.

After hearing from all speakers, Council Member Jost made a motion to lay the item over for one week, which was approved by the council. This will allow more time for consideration of the appeal and possible discussion with the university.

Other items on the agenda included several public hearings related to water services code changes, grant funding, and budget amendments. All of these items were passed without much discussion or opposition.

Overall, the meeting focused primarily on zoning appeals and conditional use permits, with significant attention given to the University of St. Thomas's appeal regarding the Goodrich Avenue driveway.
