#### Summary
The Audit Committee met to review the Community Investment Budget (CIB) process and audit report. The report was presented by Dr. Heather Britt from Wilder Research, who led the research team under retainer to conduct the audits. The report highlighted several key findings and recommendations for improving the CIB process.

Key decisions made during the meeting include:

* The committee expressed enthusiasm for continuing to mature the CIB process and addressing its complexities.
* Recommendations were made to clarify roles and responsibilities across the process, including a lead for outreach and communication.
* A pre-application phase was suggested to increase accessibility and provide technical assistance to applicants.
* Documentation of the current process and its components was recommended to improve transparency and equity.

Some areas of contention included:

* The issue of unclear roles and responsibilities among city departments and staff members.
* The need for more resources and support for CIB committee members, who are expected to act as ambassadors for their communities but lack the necessary tools and training.
* Concerns about the application process being too complex and favoring repeat applicants from more resourced neighborhoods.

The meeting also discussed the importance of community engagement and outreach, with some staff members expressing a need for clear guidance on their roles and responsibilities in this area. The committee agreed to provide feedback on the report by May 12th, with a final deadline of May 29th for the completion of the audit report.

Additionally, the committee discussed the plan for selecting a new community advisor, with Chair Noecker suggesting that members submit their top three candidates by May 6th.
