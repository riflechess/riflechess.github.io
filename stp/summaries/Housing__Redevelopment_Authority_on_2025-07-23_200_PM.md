#### Summary

The meeting began with a resolution to amend the Emergency Rental Assistance Eviction Prevention Program guidelines. The changes included updating HUD income limits and eliminating language about assistance being for one month's rent. The resolution was adopted unanimously.

Next, Senior Project Manager Annie Byrne presented an update on the Commercial Corridor Organization Assistance Program. She highlighted the program's goals, funding allocation, and progress made so far. Commissioners expressed their appreciation for the program and its benefits to various neighborhoods in Saint Paul.

The HRA-owned land development updates were presented by Principal Project Manager Daniela Lorenz. She discussed the current status of HRA-owned properties, including those that need to be disposed of or redeveloped due to HUD deadlines. The presentation included updates on several projects in progress and highlighted opportunities for developers to acquire HRA-owned land.

The final item was an update on supportive housing budget allocation. Vice Chair Johnson presented three proposals for using the $880,000 allocated for supportive housing: a proposal from the governing board to support emergency shelters, a proposal from Neighborhood House for rental assistance and deposit assistance, and a proposal from several emergency shelter providers. Commissioners expressed their support for redirecting funds towards emergency shelters, citing growing needs in this area.

Notable discussion points included Commissioner Kim's comments on the importance of supporting emergency shelters and Commissioner Provosky's question about potential risks associated with selling HRA-owned land. Director Newton clarified that any changes to the budget allocation would need to be reviewed and approved by the governing board and city council.

The meeting concluded without action, but it is expected that there will be further discussion and updates on these topics in future meetings.
