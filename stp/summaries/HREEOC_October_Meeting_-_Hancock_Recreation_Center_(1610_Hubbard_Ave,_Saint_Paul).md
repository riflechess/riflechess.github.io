#### Summary
The meeting began with a discussion of the agenda and approval of minutes from previous meetings. The rules committee presented an updated draft of a ceasefire resolution for the Israel-Palestine conflict, which was discussed and debated by commission members. Commissioner Wills raised concerns about the lack of divestment language in the resolution.

The department report was given by Sarah Ania, who discussed upcoming work with the department on partnership projects. The commission also received an update from the Human Rights Commission's Contract Compliance Division regarding affirmative action plans for city contractors.
