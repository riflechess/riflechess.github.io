#### Summary

The meeting began with the approval of minutes from the previous meeting. The first item on the agenda was a staff report on Homework Centers and Reading Together programs.

Osteen von Bergling presented the Homework Centers program, which provides free spaces for students to get help with homework from tutors or work independently. The program is available at five libraries across the city, and over 841 individual students participated in 2024. The program also offers Help Now Live Online Tutoring, a resource that is free with a library card.

Next, Osteen von Bergling presented the Reading Together program, which matches participants with volunteer mentors for weekly sessions. The program has seen a significant increase in participation and engagement, with 131 learners participating last year and a 127% increase in hours of mentee-mentor engagement.

Council Member Provotsky asked about how people find out about these programs, and Osteen von Bergling explained that word-of-mouth is a big factor, as well as outreach to schools and communities. Council Member Ager asked if homework help is available in all libraries across the city, and was told that it's not available at all libraries, but rather at five of the busiest ones.

The second item on the agenda was a staff report on the mobile library (MOBI). Savitri Santaran presented an update on MOBI's first year of operation, which has seen 32,273 visitors and 31,073 items borrowed. The mobile library has been well-received by the community, with patrons praising its convenience and accessibility.

Council Member Baratsky asked about how MOBI chooses which schools to visit, and Savitri explained that they have strong relationships with several St. Paul public schools and charter schools. Council Member Ryan expressed enthusiasm for MOBI and the homework center and Reading Together programs, highlighting their importance in introducing people to libraries and meeting communities where they are.

The meeting concluded with no further discussion or action items.
