#### Summary

The city council met on January 17, 2024. The meeting started with the consent agenda, which included items 4 through 21. After withdrawing item 5 due to duplication, the council adopted the consent agenda as amended. Item 22 was postponed until community members could join in-person. 

Next, the council discussed and approved ordinance 23-70 regarding fees associated with business activities not referenced but required by specific ordinance sections and animal fees.

The council then moved on to item 24, which involved rezoning property at 736 Oakdale Avenue from H1 Residential to T2 Traditional Neighborhood. This would allow for a multi-use residential-commercial complex. The Planning Commission voted unanimously in favor of this proposal. However, the Westside community organization did not provide a recommendation either way.

Item 25 was about granting an application to rezone property at 0 St. Clair Avenue from B1 Local Business to T3 Traditional Neighborhood. Community members testified, but there were some concerns regarding mixed-use requirements and parking demands. The council decided to lay over the ordinance for further discussion on January 24th.

The council also addressed grant funding and operating budget amendments for various programs within the city.
