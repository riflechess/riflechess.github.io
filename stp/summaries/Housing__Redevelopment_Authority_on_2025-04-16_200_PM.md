#### Summary
The meeting began with Commissioner Pabrowski's oath of office. The first item for discussion was RES 25-545, which authorized the issuance of conduit revenue bonds for the Health Partners Obligated Group Project. The bond issuance is to refinance prior bonds issued by the HRA in 2015, and staff recommended approval. Commissioner Nacre moved to approve the resolution, and it passed with a unanimous vote.

The second item was RES 25-575, which amended the 2025 Housing Redevelopment Authority HRA Loan Enterprise Fund Budget to reflect carryover from the 2024 budget for two rental rehab program projects. Staff recommended approval, and Commissioner Pravatsky moved to approve the resolution, which passed unanimously.

The third item was RES 25-581, accepting a $1,999,991 grant from the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency (MHFA) through the Minnesota Housing Community Home Ownership Impact Fund. The funds will be used for the Down Payment Assistance Program and the Homeowners' Rehab Program citywide. Commissioner Ying moved to approve the resolution, and it passed unanimously.

The fourth item was a staff report regarding the modification of the 2002 home loan to the St. Paul Family Project Limited Partnership (Owner of Jackson Street Village Project). The HRA is requesting to forgive $175,553 in accrued interest on the loan upon maturity in 2032. Commissioner Kim had been briefed on this matter and expressed strong support for the project. Commissioner Povatsky also spoke about her transportation expertise and how the project's location near a bike trail is beneficial.

Commissioner Bowie asked questions regarding RS Eden's involvement with affordable housing, particularly around their dedication to deeply affordable housing. Caroline Hood, President and CEO of RS Eden, explained that they are an owner-operator, property manager, and service provider for this project. She also discussed the rehabilitation scope and how they aim to sustain the project for 15 years.

The meeting concluded with a brief discussion about the sources of funds for the Jackson Street Village Project, including energy rebates from Excel Energy and a site assessment grant (SAG) from Ramsey County. The next agenda items will include the Power of Home and Healthy Homes Program guidelines, which have been revised in response to feedback from previous meetings.
