#### Summary

The City Council held a public hearing on Ordinance 25-55, amending Chapter 224 of the Legislative Code to align with state law changes. The council voted to lay over the ordinance until October 8th for final adoption.

Council Member Yang proposed an amendment to remove the 90-day youth wage provision in Section 224.04, which allows employees aged 14-17 to be paid at a lower rate than the city minimum wage for small employers during their first 90 days of employment. Ms. Yang argued that this provision is outdated and unnecessary, as employees will eventually make the minimum wage regardless.

Vice President Kim expressed support for the amendment, citing concerns about multi-generational households and youth contributing to household income through their work. The council voted 7-0 to lay over the ordinance until October 8th, keeping the public hearing open for further discussion.

The council also approved a resolution authorizing an increase in the Department of Parks and Recreation grant fund by $675,000 per year for two years to reflect grant funds received from the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development. The consent agenda was adopted as amended.

During the meeting's final segment, the council members shared good news and announcements, including upcoming events such as the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Twin Cities Marathon, and the Harvest Festival at Tilden Park.

The meeting adjourned after approximately 90 minutes of discussion and announcements.
