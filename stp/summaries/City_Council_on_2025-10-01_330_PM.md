#### Summary

The City Council held a public hearing on Ordinance 25-55, which amends Chapter 224 of the Legislative Code. Council Member Yang expressed opposition to Section 22, Section 224.04, specifically the 90-day youth wage clause, citing that it is outdated and unnecessary. Vice President Kim and Chair Johnson supported Yang's proposal to remove this language from the ordinance.

A motion was made by Yang to lay the matter over until next week for further discussion, keeping the public hearing open. The motion passed with seven in favor and no opposition. This means that the Council will revisit the issue of the 90-day youth wage clause at a future meeting.

The Council also held public hearings on other ordinances related to record production processes (Ordinance 25-56) and aligning with state law changes (Ordinance 25-57). These motions passed without opposition, laying them over until October 8th for final adoption.

Additionally, the Council authorized an increase in the Department of Parks and Recreation grant fund by $675,000 per year for two years to reflect grant funds received from the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development. This resolution was adopted with no opposition.

The meeting concluded with good news and announcements from various council members, including a congratulatory message for Legislative Aide Melanie Johnson's graduation from her BCLI program, information about upcoming community events, such as the Mid-Autumn Festival and the Twin Cities Marathon, and an invitation to attend the Summit Hill Association's celebration of the new and improved Linwood Park.

The Council adjourned after approximately two hours of discussion and public hearings.
