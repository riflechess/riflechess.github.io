* Purpose: To consider the mayor's line item vetoes on the 2025 budget

#### Summary
The city council met in a special session to consider five line item vetoes from the mayor on the 2025 budget. The first veto was on the City Council Office Redesign Project, which would modernize and upgrade the office space for council staff. Ms. Kim moved to override the veto, citing that the project is essential for safety, accessibility, and morale, and that it aligns with a global agreement on ARP-funded projects.

The second veto was on eliminating the human rights and equal economic opportunity director position. The council members emphasized that this was not an elimination of the position, but rather a holdback of the salary until a hiring plan is in place. Ms. Bowie spoke about the importance of filling this position, which has been vacant for over a year.

The remaining vetoes were on events and festivals programming, the council audit committee, and the St. Paul Children's Collaborative. In each case, the council members voted to override the veto, with all seven present voting in favor.

#### Highlights

* **Public Safety:** The council emphasized the importance of hiring a human rights and equal economic opportunity director, who has been vacant for over a year.
* **Fiscal Responsibility:** The council argued that eliminating or undermining the council audit committee contradicts the mayor's stated goal of fiscal prudence.
* **Community Engagement:** The council highlighted the importance of events and festivals programming in boosting cultural vitality and enhancing people's quality of life.
* **Line Item Vetoes:** All five line item vetoes were overridden, with the council voting to maintain funding for these programs and initiatives.
