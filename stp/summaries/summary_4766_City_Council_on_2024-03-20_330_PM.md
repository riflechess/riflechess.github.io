#### Summary
The city council meeting on March 20th was a relatively routine affair, with most items on the agenda being voted through without much discussion. The consent agenda, which included several resolutions related to infrastructure projects and budget adjustments, was adopted unanimously.

One notable item was the amendment to the financing and spending plans in the fire department's 2024 operating budget (Item 18). This resolution authorized the purchase of an electric vehicle charger for Fire Station 24. While this may seem like a minor issue, it's worth noting that the city has been investing heavily in sustainable infrastructure projects.

The council also voted to continue the public hearing on RLHRR 23-70 (Item 21) until April 3rd, which relates to an appealed substantial abatement order for a property at 342 Thomas Avenue. This item was brought up by Council Member Johnson, who requested that the public hearing be continued for two weeks.

The meeting concluded with a series of announcements from council members regarding upcoming events and initiatives in their respective wards. These included a community iftar celebration, an expungement clinic, and a district council planning meeting.

#### Highlights

* **Public Safety:** The city is continuing to invest in sustainable infrastructure projects, including the purchase of electric vehicle chargers for fire stations.
* **Fiscal Responsibility:** While some may see the budget adjustments as minor, it's worth noting that the city is still grappling with issues related to fiscal responsibility and transparency. The council voted to carry forward unspent budget authority from 2023 (Item 19), which raises questions about the effectiveness of the city's budgeting process.
* **Community Engagement:** The meeting concluded with a series of announcements from council members regarding upcoming events and initiatives in their respective wards. These included a community iftar celebration, an expungement clinic, and a district council planning meeting.
* **Displacement on the Westside:** Council Member Nacre highlighted a community meeting being organized by the Westside Community Organization and Research in Action to discuss the displacement of Westsiders on the Westside. This issue has been ongoing for several years and highlights the need for more effective policies to address gentrification and displacement in Saint Paul.
