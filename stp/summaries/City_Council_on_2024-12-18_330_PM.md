#### Summary

The city council meeting covered a variety of topics, including zoning appeals, community development grants, and legislation affecting the city's infrastructure. The meeting began with a discussion on Item 22, an appeal by Benegas Properties LLC regarding two variance requests for constructing a multifamily dwelling at 1963 Grand Avenue.

Next, the council discussed Resolution 24-1937, authorizing the Department of Safety and Inspections to enter into a settlement agreement on behalf of Maryland One Stop Food and Fuel Market, Inc., doing business as Maryland Amoco BP Marketplace. This resolution was also approved with unanimous consent.

The meeting then moved on to Item 23, the final adoption of Ordinance 24-18, establishing the classification titled Senior Legislative Aid in the Unclassified Service. The ordinance was adopted with seven votes in favor and none opposed.
