#### Summary

The meeting focused on discussing the work plan priorities and budget allocation within the $250,000 allocated to the Reparations Commission. Commissioner English emphasized that the harm report is a priority for the commission and should be done by the community listening sessions, as it will inform their recommendations to the city council.

The discussion centered around clarifying the scope of work for the harm report and determining how much money to allocate to each project within the $250,000 budget. Commissioner Golden suggested that the city consider allocating funds for community listening sessions in areas with large black populations instead of spreading them across every district or ward.

Commissioner McCoy proposed reducing the work plan budget by deleting the legal question section, which was estimated at around $80,000-$100,000, as this task would be handled by the city attorney's office.

Council Member Johnson provided an update on her previous meetings with the commission and expressed her support for their efforts. She encouraged the commission to focus on providing recommendations rather than trying to land specific numbers or allocations.

The meeting also touched on the RFP process for consultants, with Commissioner English explaining that the commission does not need to go through a formal RFP process but can instead work directly with procurement officials to identify potential vendors and determine costs.

Council Member Bowie presented a resolution establishing a legislative advisory committee to create an equitable framework for administering fees and fines. The committee will consist of eight members, including a representative from the Reparations Commission, and will review existing policies and provide recommendations to the city council.

Finally, the meeting concluded with Council Members Johnson and Bowie recommending two candidates to serve on the reparations commission: Markita Common and Johnny Waters.
