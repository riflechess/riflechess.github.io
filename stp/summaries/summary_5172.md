#### Summary

The meeting began with the election of new officers for the city council, with Council Member Nacre elected as president and Council Vice President Kim as vice chair. The consent agenda items were approved without discussion.

The public hearing on Ordinance 25-17, granting a zoning change to allow for residential development at 25 George Street East, was closed due to lack of testimony. A similar situation occurred with the public hearing on Ordinance 25-18, granting a zoning change to allow for commercial development at 642 Selby Avenue.

The city council also considered two appeals related to zoning variances for Ryan Companies' proposed mixed-use development in the Highland Bridge area. The first appeal concerned Block 2B, while the second appeal concerned Block 2C. Several members of the public testified against the variance requests, citing concerns about density and sustainability. Council Member Yang expressed support for the project but acknowledged that it deviated from the master plan.

The city council also considered a resolution to ratify a special tax assessment for property at 1689 Rainey Avenue East, which had been incurred by the previous owner but was not disclosed to the new owner. Council Member Johnson made a motion to waive the assessment, citing concerns about fairness and equity. However, the motion failed with a vote of two in favor and four opposed.

The legislative hearing consent agenda items 27 through 61 were also considered, including a request for item number 49 to be pulled from the consent calendar.
