#### Summary
The meeting began with a brief review of upcoming agenda items. Committee members discussed the proposed expansion of Terminal 1-Lindbergh at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport (MSP). The plan includes adding new gates and increasing parking capacity.

A key point of discussion was the impact on surrounding communities, particularly in terms of noise pollution. Several community representatives expressed concerns about potential disruptions to local residents' quality of life. Committee members acknowledged these concerns but emphasized that the expansion is necessary for the airport's growth and competitiveness.

Regarding budget allocations, it was announced that an additional $10 million will be allocated to address noise mitigation measures, including sound barriers and insulation for nearby homes.

One contentious issue arose during a discussion on taxiway rehabilitation projects. Ward Nacre (corrected from "Nacre") expressed concerns about the potential impact on local businesses, arguing that the project's timeline could lead to significant disruptions. Other committee members countered that the project is essential for maintaining airport safety and efficiency.

The committee voted 7-2 in favor of proceeding with the terminal expansion plan, with Wards Nacre (corrected from "Nacre") and Ward Johnson dissenting due to concerns about noise pollution and potential impacts on local residents. The meeting concluded with a review of upcoming agenda items for the next MACPD Meeting.
