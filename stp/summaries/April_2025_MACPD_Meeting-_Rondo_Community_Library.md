#### Summary

The MACPD meeting on April 10th focused on public art projects in the Rondo community. The main topic of discussion was a proposal for a new public art installation at the Rondo Community Library. The proposed artwork, titled "Community Roots," is designed to reflect the rich history and culture of the Rondo neighborhood.

The proposal received generally positive feedback from committee members. However, there were some concerns raised about the cost of the project, with some members questioning whether it aligns with the city's budget priorities. A motion was made to allocate $150,000 for the project, but it passed with a divided vote: 5 in favor and 3 opposed.

One member expressed concern that the allocation could be better spent on community programs or infrastructure projects. Another member argued that public art can have long-term benefits for community engagement and economic development. The proposal ultimately passed, but not without some dissenting voices.

Additionally, the committee discussed other ongoing public art projects in the Rondo neighborhood, including a mural at the corner of University Avenue and Lexington Parkway. Members expressed enthusiasm for these projects and discussed potential opportunities for collaboration with local artists and organizations.

The next MACPD meeting is scheduled for May 8th at 6:00 PM at the Rondo Community Library.
