It's worth noting that some of the discussions during the meeting seemed to be more focused on ceremonial aspects (e.g. the swearing-in ceremony) or on sharing good news from around the wards rather than actual policy discussions. Additionally, there were several resolutions passed with unanimous approval, which may indicate a lack of debate or discussion on these items.

In terms of public safety and quality of life issues, the meeting did touch on some topics related to infrastructure projects and tree removal, but it's unclear what specific actions will be taken to address these concerns.
