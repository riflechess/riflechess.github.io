#### Summary

The meeting began with introductions and updates from various board members. Notably, Ms. Yang discussed her work on the Transportation Advisory Board, where they have been reviewing funding criteria for regional solicitation funding. Another topic of discussion was the new Water Board payment portal, which aims to make payments easier and reduce fees.

Council Member Johnson shared his experiences with serving on several boards and committees, including the Downtown Alliance and Visit St. Paul. He highlighted the importance of downtown revitalization efforts and proposed financial incentives for businesses in need.

A major point of discussion was the Riverview Corridor project, where Council Members Jost and Nacker presented updates on the project's progress and timeline. They emphasized the need to prioritize pedestrian improvements and beautification of West 7th Street. Other council members shared their support for the project and expressed enthusiasm for its potential benefits.

Next, the committee discussed the event and festival security costs proposal by Council Members Bowie and Nacker. The proposal aims to provide a security credit to organizations hosting events in St. Paul, with criteria including that the organization be based in St. Paul, host an accessible and free event, and have at least five years of experience.

The discussion on the proposal covered various topics, including the long-term solution for reducing security costs, potential restrictions on who receives funding, and whether receiving Cultural Star grants would impact eligibility for the city's program. Council Member Yang emphasized the importance of equity in the criteria and suggested incentivizing organizations to host events in areas of concentrated poverty.

The meeting concluded with a decision to move forward with drafting a resolution based on the feedback received during the discussion. The goal is to have the resolution ready by next week, which would formalize the program and provide clarity for event organizers.
