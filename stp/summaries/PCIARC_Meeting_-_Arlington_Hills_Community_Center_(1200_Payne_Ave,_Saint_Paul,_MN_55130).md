#### Meeting Info
**Meeting Type:** PCIARC Meeting
**Purpose:** Review of Community Development Projects and Budget Allocation
**Date/Time:** Tuesday, March 14, 2023, at 6:00 PM
**Location:** Arlington Hills Community Center (1200 Payne Ave, Saint Paul, MN 55130)

#### Summary
The PCIARC meeting covered several community development projects and budget allocations for the upcoming year. Key decisions include:

* **Budget Allocation:** The committee approved an increase in funding for the neighborhood's park improvement project by $50,000.
* **Business Development:** A new coffee shop on Payne Avenue was discussed, with a potential storefront renovation proposal.
* **Public Safety:** Residents raised concerns about recent break-ins and property damage in the area. The police department assured them that increased patrols would be deployed.

A notable point of contention arose during the discussion of a proposed zoning change for a vacant lot near Arlington Hills Park. One resident expressed concerns that it would lead to overdevelopment and negatively impact the neighborhood's character, while another argued that it was necessary for economic growth. The committee ultimately decided to table the proposal until further research can be conducted.

Additionally, the meeting touched on plans for a community garden on an underutilized city-owned lot in the area. Residents expressed enthusiasm for this project, which aims to provide green space and educational opportunities for local residents.

The next PCIARC meeting is scheduled for April 11, 2023.
