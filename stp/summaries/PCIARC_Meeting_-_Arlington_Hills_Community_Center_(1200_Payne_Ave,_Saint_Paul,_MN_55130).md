#### Summary

The PCIARC meeting began with a review of several development proposals in the city. The most notable proposal was for a new multi-unit residential building on University Avenue near the state capitol. The proposal includes plans for a rooftop garden and additional community space.

A zoning variance request from a business owner in the Frogtown neighborhood was also discussed. The owner is seeking to expand their current commercial use, but neighbors have expressed concerns about increased noise and traffic.

The committee voted 5-2 in favor of approving the development proposal on University Avenue, with Commissioner Johnson and Commissioner Rodriguez dissenting due to concerns about density and parking.

Regarding the Frogtown zoning variance request, a motion was made to table the decision until further review of mitigation measures can be conducted. The vote was 4-3 in favor of tabling, with Commissioners Lee, Patel, and Wang opposing due to concerns that delaying the decision would harm the business owner's ability to expand.

No decisions were made regarding public safety or quality of life issues during this meeting.
