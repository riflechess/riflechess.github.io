#### Summary

The meeting began with a review of several zoning cases, including a proposal for a new apartment complex in the Highland Park neighborhood. The commission voted unanimously to approve the project, citing its alignment with city planning goals.

A variance request for a property on University Avenue was also discussed. The applicant sought permission to build a larger structure than allowed by current zoning regulations. After some debate, the commission voted 5-3 to deny the request, citing concerns about over-development and potential impact on traffic.

The commission also reviewed a proposal to establish a community garden in the Arlington Hills neighborhood. The proposal was met with enthusiasm from local residents, who spoke in favor of the project during public comment. The commission voted unanimously to approve the plan, providing funding for the project through the city's community development budget.

A final item on the agenda was a review of crime statistics in the area. Saint Paul Police Department representatives reported a decrease in crime rates over the past quarter, but noted an uptick in property crimes near commercial districts. The commission discussed potential solutions to address this trend, including increased police presence and community outreach programs.
