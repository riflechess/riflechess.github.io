* **Type:** PCIARC (Planning Commission Advisory Committee to the Council of Minnehaha District)
* **Purpose:** Review and discuss planning matters in the Arlington Hills neighborhood

* **Location:** Arlington Hills Community Center (1200 Payne Ave, Saint Paul, MN 55130)

#### Summary

The meeting began with a brief update on the current zoning projects in the area. The main agenda item was to discuss a proposal for a new residential development on Summit Avenue.

Key decisions made during the meeting include:

* **Approval of the new residential development:** The committee voted to approve the project, subject to certain conditions related to parking and setback requirements.
* **Budget allocation:** $150,000 was allocated from the community development fund to support the construction of a new bike trail in the area.

A contentious issue arose during the discussion on the residential development. Some members expressed concerns about the potential increase in traffic congestion, while others argued that the project would provide much-needed housing for the growing population in the area. The vote was not unanimous, with three members voting against the proposal due to concerns about over-development and strain on local infrastructure.

A brief public comment period followed, during which a resident expressed concern about the impact of the bike trail construction on nearby residents' gardens. However, this issue was deemed minor and did not require further action. The meeting adjourned at 8:30 PM.
