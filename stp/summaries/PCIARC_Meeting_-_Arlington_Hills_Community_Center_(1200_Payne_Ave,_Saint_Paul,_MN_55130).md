#### Summary
The PCIARC meeting covered several items related to land use and zoning in the city. The main topics discussed were:

* Proposed changes to the zoning ordinance for the University of St. Thomas campus expansion, which was met with some resistance from nearby residents concerned about increased traffic and density.
* A request by a local business owner to rezone their property for a new apartment complex, which was approved unanimously after a brief discussion on parking and access.
* An update on the city's affordable housing initiatives, including a proposed ordinance to require inclusionary zoning in certain areas of the city. This sparked some debate among commissioners about the effectiveness and fairness of such policies.

The most contentious issue was the proposal for the University of St. Thomas expansion. Commissioner Johnson expressed concerns about the impact on nearby residents, while Commissioner Rodriguez argued that the benefits of the project outweighed the costs. The matter was tabled until the next meeting to allow for further review and discussion.

In other news, the city's public works department reported on progress made in improving bike lanes and pedestrian safety throughout the city.
