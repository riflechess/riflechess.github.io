#### Meeting Info
Meeting Type: Organizational Committee
Date/Time: 2025-08-13, 10:00 AM
Location: City of Saint Paul
Summary:

The meeting began with a presentation on the city's new legislative drafting process. The committee discussed two items related to this process: a cartoon ordinance for multi-unit properties and proposed ordinance amendments for city registration for the state of Minnesota cannabis.

The first item was a proposal to allow cart sharing among multi-unit properties, which would reduce waste and make it easier for residents to manage their trash. The committee members asked questions about the payment system, truck sizes, and billing.

The second item was related to cannabis registration. The city's director presented on the state's cannabis law and regulations, highlighting the complexity of the legislation and the role of the city in registering retailers. The committee discussed potential concerns regarding temporary cannabis events and the proximity to schools and childcare facilities.

After a brief technical issue with the presentation from We Make Minnesota, Eric Bernstein spoke about sustainable funding for local government. He highlighted that the United States is a low-tax country compared to other developed economies and emphasized the importance of investing in public welfare. He presented data on St. Paul's revenue sources and expenditures, noting that property taxes are a significant source of municipal revenue but can be less progressive than income or corporate taxes.

The committee also discussed progressivity and regressivity in property tax assessments, with Council Member Provosky pointing out that the current system is not fair. Bernstein suggested experimenting with a land value tax, which would incentivize density and vibrancy in cities. He also mentioned urban wealth funds and local income taxes as potential ideas for sustainable funding.

The meeting concluded with thanks to Eric Bernstein for his presentation and recommendations for future work.
