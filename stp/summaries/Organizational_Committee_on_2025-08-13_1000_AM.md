#### Summary
The meeting began with a discussion on proposed ordinance amendments for city registration for the state of Minnesota cannabis. The Director of Public Works presented an overview of the process, highlighting key aspects such as zoning compliance, youth compliance checks, and temporary cannabis events. A map showing retail zones in pink was displayed, but it did not show all license types. Vice President Kim and Councilor Provatsky expressed support for the retail establishments coming to St. Paul, noting that they would provide a new way for long-time neighborhood families and business owners to take advantage of retail space.

Councilor Provosky also suggested creating standard language for responding to inquiries about cannabis regulations from entrepreneurs planning to open up. The Director confirmed that the maximum fees set by state law were being requested, but noted that there was still a gap between these fees and the costs of enforcement.

The second item on the agenda was a presentation from We Make Minnesota on sustainable funding. Eric Bernstein presented on the importance of public investment in cities and how St. Paul compares to other developed economies. He highlighted the fact that the US is a low-tax country, raising and spending less as a share of its total wealth than almost anywhere else.

Bernstein compared St. Paul's revenue sources to those of Minneapolis and other major metropolitan areas, noting that while both cities have similar tax revenues, St. Paul receives less in intergovernmental support. He also highlighted the importance of considering property taxes, which are not tied to income, and how this can create a burden for some homeowners.

Councilor Provosky shared his own experiences with property taxes, noting that holding the levy flat for 13 straight years was one of the most reckless decisions a municipal government has ever made. He emphasized the importance of considering progressivity versus regressivity in property tax assessments and suggested tweaking the percentage weights to make it more progressive.

Bernstein then discussed various options for reforming the property tax system, including a land value tax, which would assess based on the value of the land rather than physical structures. This would incentivize density and could help shift land use from car-centric design to people-centric design. He also mentioned the concept of an urban wealth fund and local income taxes as potential solutions for funding public goods and services.

The meeting concluded with no further questions or comments, and Councilor Nacre thanked Bernstein for his presentation.
