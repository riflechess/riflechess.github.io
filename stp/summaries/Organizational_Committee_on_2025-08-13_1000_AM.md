#### Summary
The meeting started with a discussion on proposed ordinance amendments for city registration for the state of Minnesota cannabis. The director explained that the city's role in cannabis regulation is zoning compliance, and they will register retailers who meet certain requirements. The council members asked questions about the process, fees, and hours of operation.

Next, the committee heard from Eric Bernstein from We Make Minnesota on sustainable funding. He discussed how cities in developed economies typically raise more tax revenue than St. Paul and Minneapolis, and that the state's spending as a share of total wealth is lower compared to other nations. He also presented data on property taxes, showing that they are the largest source of municipal revenue but not progressive.

The discussion then turned to property taxes, with Bernstein defending their use as an effective way to raise revenue due to their dependability and ability to tax wealth. Council Member Jost raised concerns about the impact on low-income residents and retirees, while Provostky mentioned that St. Paul held its levy flat in real dollars for 13 straight years from 1993-2006.

Bernstein suggested exploring a land value tax, which would incentivize density and reduce the burden on single-family homes. He also mentioned an urban wealth fund concept and local income taxes. The meeting concluded with thanks to Bernstein for his presentation and adjournment.

There were no significant disagreements or contentious votes during this meeting.
