#### Summary
The Local Safety Advisory Committee met to discuss various public safety concerns in Saint Paul. Key topics included:
* Update on the new Community Response Unit (CRU) pilot program: The CRU will be a partnership between the police department and community organizations to respond to low-level calls for service.
* Discussion of proposed budget allocations for public safety initiatives, including a $500,000 allocation for additional police training programs.

A contentious issue arose during the discussion on the CRU pilot program. Council Member Maria Sanchez expressed concerns that the program may not adequately address the root causes of crime in Saint Paul's neighborhoods. She argued that the city should focus on investing in community-based programs rather than relying solely on law enforcement. The debate continued for several minutes, with some committee members agreeing with Sanchez's perspective and others expressing support for the CRU pilot as a necessary step towards improving public safety.

The committee also heard from several residents who expressed concerns about crime in their neighborhoods, including break-ins and property damage. In response to these concerns, Police Chief Brian O'Hara outlined steps being taken by the department to increase patrols and engage with community members.

Overall, the meeting highlighted ongoing efforts by city officials to address public safety concerns through a combination of law enforcement initiatives and community-based programs.
