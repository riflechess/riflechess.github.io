#### Summary

The meeting started with a roll call of council members, followed by the approval of the consent agenda. Resolution 25-805 was approved, appointing Laura Logsdon as interim director of the Office of Financial Services.

Next, the council discussed and voted on resolution 25-788, which renames Bruce Bento Nature Sanctuary and Indian Mounds Regional Park to reflect Dakota cultural significance. The motion to approve this resolution was made by Council Member Johnson and seconded by Vice President Kim. After some discussion, the resolution was adopted with a vote of 7 in favor and none opposed.

The council also discussed and voted on several other resolutions, including:

* Resolution 25-94, which approved a sound-level variance for Shine in the World Ministries to present amplified sound during the Merge Twin Cities events.
* Resolution 25-90, which amended the financing and spending plan in the Department of Parks and Recreation by $2,500,000 to reflect funds awarded from the Department of Employment and Economic Development.
* Resolution 25-95, which approved a sound-level variance for Ordway Center to present amplified sound during events on May 28th through May 31st.

The council also held a public hearing on item number 27, amending the financing and spending plans in the lease department grant fund. No one spoke during this public hearing.

However, the most contentious issue of the meeting was the appeal of the West 7th Fort Road Federation regarding the site plan for FCC's public works yard at 560 Randolph Avenue. Several members of the community testified against the proposal, citing concerns about traffic patterns, air quality, water quality, and noise pollution. The council ultimately voted to deny the appeal with a vote of 6 in favor and none opposed.

The meeting concluded with the ratification of the special tax assessment for property at 685 Minnehaha Avenue East and the approval of the legislative hearing consent agenda items.

#### Contention

The most contentious issue of the meeting was the appeal of the West 7th Fort Road Federation regarding the site plan for FCC's public works yard at 560 Randolph Avenue. Several community members testified against the proposal, citing concerns about traffic patterns, air quality, water quality, and noise pollution. The council ultimately voted to deny the appeal with a vote of 6 in favor and none opposed.

Council Member Johnson noted that this was "a necessary first step" towards ensuring that Dakota voices are at the center of city processes involving public land, especially Dakota land. She emphasized that this is not just about renaming sites but also about acknowledging the history and significance of these places.

Some community members expressed frustration with the process and felt that their concerns were being ignored. They highlighted issues such as lack of community engagement, dismissal of neighbors' concerns, and the potential negative impacts on the neighborhood's health, safety, and livability.

Council Vice President Kim acknowledged the community's concerns and expressed a willingness to work with them to address these issues. He noted that there are constraints within the council's capacity, but he is committed to supporting efforts for more community engagement and collaboration between FCC and the West 7th Fort Road Federation.
