#### Summary
Unfortunately, there is no actual discussion or meeting summary to report on due to the repetitive "We'll be right back" statements throughout the entire recording. It appears that the meeting was interrupted and never resumed.

If you're interested in staying up-to-date with library board meetings, I recommend checking the city's website or contacting the library directly for more information on future meetings and their agendas.
