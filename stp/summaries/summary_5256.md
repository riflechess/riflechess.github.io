Meeting Description: Live and Recorded Public meetings of City Council on 2025-04-09 3:30 PM for City of Saint Paul


#### Summary

The meeting consisted of several agenda items, including public hearings on rent stabilization ordinances, vacant building fees, and a resolution to establish a public safety committee. 

In the first part of the meeting, the council discussed item 27, which was about ratifying an appealed special tax assessment for property at 586 Burgess Street. The recommendation included amending the policy for assessing payment periods for such assessments.

The next item discussed was the vacant building fee assessment for properties at 759 Charles Avenue and 120 Lighten Place. Public hearings were held on both items, and council members listened to testimony from residents who are impacted by these fees.

Item 28-54 were all legislative hearing items that would require public comment, but only item 33 had a testifier, Tom D. Kong, who spoke about his experience with vacant building fees.

The council then moved on to the resolution 25-434, which was amending appendix A2 of the administrative code to establish the creation of the city council public safety and community wellness committee. Council member Bowie provided an extensive report on her efforts to create this new subcommittee, citing its importance for residents' safety and well-being.

Next, Director Angie Wiese presented a staff report on item 22, which was about amending Chapter 310.04 of the Legislative Code regarding cancellation methods when licensees are not in compliance with providing materials for licensed activities. This ordinance aimed to simplify the process of canceling business licenses that are no longer active.

Items 23 and 24 were public hearings on zoning amendments and rent stabilization ordinances, respectively. However, only a few speakers testified during these hearings.

The final agenda item was a long public hearing on items 25-29 regarding rent stabilization, which received extensive testimony from over 20 speakers. Many residents supported the proposed amendment to exempt new residential buildings from rent control, citing its potential to increase housing supply and encourage development in St. Paul.


#### Highlights

**Public Safety Committee:** Council member Bowie presented a resolution to establish a public safety committee as a subcommittee of the council. She emphasized that public safety is no less important than other essential services, and that this vote would be about giving residents a transparent space to engage with large portions of their city's budget.

**Rent Stabilization Ordinance:** The public hearing on items 25-29 regarding rent stabilization received extensive testimony from over 20 speakers. Many residents supported the proposed amendment to exempt new residential buildings from rent control, citing its potential to increase housing supply and encourage development in St. Paul. Some opponents argued that this would weaken tenant protections and hurt low-income renters.

**Vacant Building Fees:** The public hearings on items 27 and 28-33 regarding vacant building fees saw testimony from residents who are impacted by these fees. Council members discussed possible amendments to the policy for assessing payment periods for such assessments.

**Tenant Protections Ordinance:** A long public hearing was held on item 25, which included a proposed ordinance creating Chapter 193 of the Legislative Code pertaining to tenant protections. Testimony from over 10 speakers highlighted issues with current landlord-tenant laws and emphasized the need for greater protections for renters.
