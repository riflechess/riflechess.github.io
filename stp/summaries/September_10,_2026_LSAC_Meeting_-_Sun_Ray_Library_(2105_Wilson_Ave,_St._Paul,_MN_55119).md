* Purpose: Discuss and review land use proposals, zoning changes, and other development-related issues in the city of Saint Paul

#### Summary

The LSAC meeting began with a presentation from the Planning Department on several proposed zoning changes in the city's Midway neighborhood. The proposals aim to rezone areas around University Avenue to allow for more mixed-use development and to reduce parking requirements.

Key points:

* Proposal to rezone 5 parcels of land along University Avenue to accommodate taller buildings (up to 10 stories) with commercial space on the ground floor and residential units above
* Reduction in required parking spaces for new developments, citing concerns about limited street parking and promoting walkability

The proposals were met with some opposition from nearby residents who expressed concerns about increased density, noise, and traffic congestion. One resident spoke out against the zoning changes, arguing that they would lead to "overdevelopment" of the area.

The LSAC voted 7-3 in favor of moving forward with the proposed zoning changes, despite the opposition. The dissenting votes came from members who argued that the proposals do not adequately address concerns about parking and traffic.
