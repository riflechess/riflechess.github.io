#### Summary
The meeting focused on the redevelopment plans for the Rondo Community Library area. The proposed plan includes renovating the library building, adding a community garden, and increasing parking capacity.

A key point of discussion was the potential impact on the surrounding businesses. Some attendees expressed concerns that the increased traffic from the renovated library might disrupt their operations. In response, MACPD members assured them that they would work closely with local business owners to mitigate any negative effects.

The plan also includes a proposed increase in property taxes for area residents. However, there was no consensus on this point, and some attendees expressed opposition to the tax hike. Council Member Noecker (Noecker) argued that the increased funding is necessary to support community programs and services, but others countered that it would unfairly burden local families.

The meeting concluded with a vote on the proposal. While most members voted in favor of the plan, two councilors abstained due to concerns over property tax increases.
