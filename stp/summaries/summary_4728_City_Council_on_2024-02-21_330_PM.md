#### Summary
The meeting began with a roll call and the pledge of allegiance. The council then moved to consider their consent agenda, which was adopted as amended after Councilor Bui moved to adopt the remainder of the agenda. Councilor Nacre flagged item number 7 for review between now and next week's meeting. Item number 17 was read by Ms. More.

#### Highlights

The highlight of the meeting was the discussion around the consent agenda, specifically item number 7, which deals with the negotiated contract with the St. Paul Police Federation. Councilor Nacre moved to flag this item for review between now and next week's meeting. 

This contract is a significant issue as it affects public safety in Saint Paul. Unfortunately, due to the absurdly long readout of item number 17 (a total of 106 iterations), no meaningful discussion occurred regarding the content or implications of the contract.
