#### Summary
The meeting began with an overview of the Office of Financial Services (OFS) proposed budget for 2026. Laura Logsson, Interim Director of OFS, presented a detailed review of the department's budget, highlighting key changes and initiatives. The proposed budget includes a slight increase in general fund allocation ($34,000) and reduces OFS's attrition budget to $200,000.

Council Member Johnson questioned the significant variance between budgeted and actual spending for 2025 ($1.5 million), with most of it attributed to intentional not spending due to the cyber incident and long-term vacancies. Director Logsson explained that the city is working on improving the budget-to-actual conversations and reporting style, which would allow for more real-time tracking of spending.

The meeting also covered the Capital Improvement Budget (CIB) process, presented by Neil Younghands. He provided an overview of CIB's funding sources, including local general obligation bonds, municipal state aid, and other revenue streams. The proposed budget for 2026 includes $3.9 million in CIB bonds.

Council Member Bowie raised concerns about equity in the distribution of resources across the city, citing a historical trend of reduction in investment in certain neighborhoods, particularly the North End. Council President Noecker suggested involving the chair of the CIB committee and members in future discussions with the council to provide more context behind their decisions.

The meeting concluded with questions from council members regarding the OFS and CIB budgets, including concerns about transparency in decision-making and representation on the CIB committee.
