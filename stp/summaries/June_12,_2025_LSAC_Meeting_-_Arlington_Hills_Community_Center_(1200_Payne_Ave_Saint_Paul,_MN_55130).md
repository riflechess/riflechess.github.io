#### Summary

The meeting was attended by local residents, business owners, and city officials. The main topics of discussion were:

* Review of the proposed improvements to Mears Park: The committee discussed the design plans for the park's renovation, which includes new walking paths, a community garden, and improved lighting.
* Update on the Lowertown Business Association's (LBA) initiatives: The LBA presented their efforts to support local businesses through events and marketing campaigns.

Some concerns were raised about the potential impact of increased traffic in the area due to the park renovations. However, these discussions were largely centered around finding solutions to mitigate the effects rather than opposing the project outright.

The committee also reviewed a proposed budget for community development projects in the Lowertown area. Some members expressed concerns about allocating funds towards specific projects without adequate public input. The discussion was contentious at times, with some arguing that more time should be spent on outreach and engagement before making decisions on funding allocations.

**Vote:** After some debate, the committee voted 6-3 to approve the proposed budget for community development projects. Those voting against the proposal cited concerns about inadequate public input and a lack of transparency in the budgeting process.

The meeting concluded with an open discussion period, during which attendees raised additional questions and concerns about various topics related to community development in Lowertown.
