#### Summary

The Planning Commission held a special meeting to discuss a proposed mixed-use development project in the Midway neighborhood. The project, submitted by Midway Development Partners, aims to redevelop an existing strip mall on University Avenue.

Key points discussed:

* The proposal includes 200 residential units, 20% of which will be reserved for affordable housing
* A new grocery store and retail space are planned as part of the development
* Concerns were raised about traffic congestion and parking in the area

Commissioners discussed the project's pros and cons, weighing the benefits of increased density and diversity against potential drawbacks such as increased traffic. Commissioner Maria Rodriguez expressed concerns about the affordable housing component, stating that 20% is not sufficient to meet the city's needs.

The commission ultimately voted 5-2 to approve the proposal with conditions. Commissioners John Lee and Jane Smith dissented, citing concerns about overdevelopment in the area and potential negative impacts on local businesses.
