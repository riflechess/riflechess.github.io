Neil Young Hands, a financial advisor from the Office of Financial Services, presented Resolution 24-1229 regarding the issuance of sewer revenue bonds Series 2024 D. The council members expressed their approval for the resolution.

Next, Councilmember Johnson presented a staff report on zoning regulations for cannabis businesses in Saint Paul. He discussed the need to create zoning regulations in response to Minnesota State Statute Chapter 342, which legalized the possession, use, manufacturing, and sale of certain cannabis products within the state. The council members asked questions about the proposed amendments and the differences between micro and meso businesses.

Councilmember Nacre suggested an extended public hearing on this item so that businesses and residents can testify in person and submit comments. The ordinance was laid over to September 4th for a second reading public hearing.

The meeting also discussed Resolution 24-55, which amends the financing and spending plan of the Department of Parks and Recreation by increasing the 2024 budget using fund balance to reflect previously awarded funding from the Como Shuttle Legacy Grant, Great River Passage Legacy Grant, and Parkland Dedication Funds. The council members approved this resolution.

Furthermore, the meeting touched on Resolution 24-181, which approves the request of Energy Park Utility Company to amend rates. This resolution was also approved by the council members.

The meeting concluded with discussions on property ownership issues, specifically a vacant building registration notice for property located at 1478 Blair Avenue.
