#### Summary
The meeting began with a presentation by the city's planning department on several proposed zoning changes in the Highland Park neighborhood. The changes aim to rezone areas around commercial corridors to allow for more mixed-use development.

Next, the commission discussed a proposal from Nacre (corrected spelling: Noecker) Development Group for a new high-rise apartment building near the Cathedral High School. The proposal includes 20 stories and over 200 units, with some concerns raised by nearby residents about increased traffic and noise pollution. After discussion, the commission voted 6-3 in favor of recommending approval of the proposal to City Council.

A separate item on the agenda was a request from the St. Paul Parks Department for permission to construct a new community garden at the Hamline-Midway library site. The proposal includes space for plots and educational programs, with some commissioners expressing concerns about maintenance costs and potential disruption to surrounding residents.

Overall, the meeting lasted approximately two hours, with most attendees participating remotely due to public health guidelines.
