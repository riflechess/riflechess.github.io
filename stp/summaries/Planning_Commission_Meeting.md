#### Summary

The meeting began with the approval of minutes from the previous Planning Commission meeting. The chair then passed the time to Director Nacre (corrected from "Nacre" to "Noecker"), who announced that the next meeting would be held in the council chambers and that staff is working on configuring audio and seating for the public hearing.

The zoning committee reported on their upcoming meeting, which will consider three items: a CUP for an impound lot building, a CUP for an increase in building height at the Victoria and Grand intersection, and a site plan review for 560 Randolph Avenue.

The comprehensive neighborhood planning committee held a public hearing on minor text amendments to the zoning study. Although no one testified during the public hearing, Commissioner Hulse moved to close the hearing and refer the matter back to the CNPC with the record open until April 21st at 4:30 PM. The motion passed unanimously.

Director Noecker then gave an update on the transportation committee, which will meet again on April 21st to hear from public works on two items: shared mobility and downtown sidewalk plans. Commissioner Thomas was not present, but Commissioner Risberg reported that there were no updates from the communications and nominations committee.

The director also presented a presentation she attended at the American Planning Association Conference in Denver, which discussed "Can Your Zoning Hack It?" The presentation highlighted the importance of flexible zoning codes and how different cities are approaching this issue. Director Noecker also discussed her experience with modular zoning codes and form-based zoning, noting that St. Paul's zoning code is more flexible than many other places.

Commissioners had some questions and discussion about the activity part of the presentation, which involved a "code hack exercise" where participants were given lots on paper and asked to fit different developments onto them while following regulations. This activity was well-received by commissioners, who saw it as a useful tool for public outreach and education.

The meeting also included an update from Commissioner Ortega about the CNPC's work on T zoning districts, which will have significant adjustments made to them. Finally, Director Noecker gave a presentation about the 411 Lexington Parkway tour, showcasing the building's amenities and design features, including its transportation-focused amenities and mixed-income units.

The meeting concluded with comments from Commissioner Riley, who thanked the director for taking the commission on the tour and suggested that similar tours could be beneficial in the future. The meeting was then adjourned.
