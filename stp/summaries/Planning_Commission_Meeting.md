#### Summary
The meeting began with the approval of minutes from the May 30th Planning Commission meeting. The next item was a presentation by Commissioner Nacre (presumably Noecker) regarding the zoning committee's recommendations.

Three items were approved unanimously:

1. 1944 Rental Hall: A reception hall rental proposal for approval on a specific property, recommended for approval.
2. 2284 7th Street West: An official use permit for commercial use conversion to residential use, with conditions.
3. 1190 James: The reuse of a large structure as a wellness center, with concerns around parking.

The zoning committee also discussed the Energy Park Commercial Development District, which was found to be in compliance with the comprehensive plan. A motion was made to recommend its expansion, and it passed unanimously.

A public hearing on traditional neighborhood zoning text took place, with several speakers expressing support for the study and proposed changes. The speakers included Luke Hansen from Sustain Saint Paul, who suggested expanding the T-districts around the city and simplifying the zoning code.

The Planning Commission voted to close the public hearing and take it under advisement. Commissioner Riley proposed a motion to support an additional study on expanding traditional neighborhood districts, but it was tabled for consideration in the Comprehensive Neighborhood Planning Committee (CNPC).

Other business items included a report from Commissioner Risberg regarding the Transportation Committee's next meeting and a discussion about new business, including the 2026 budget process and engagement from the mayor's office.
