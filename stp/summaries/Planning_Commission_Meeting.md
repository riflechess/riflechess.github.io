#### Meeting Info
**Type:** Planning Commission Meeting
**Purpose:** Review and discuss development proposals, zoning changes, and other planning-related matters

**Location:** Saint Paul City Hall, Council Chamber

#### Summary
The Planning Commission meeting covered several topics:

* **Development Proposals:** The commission reviewed three development proposals for new construction projects in the city. Two of the proposals were approved with minor modifications.
* **Zoning Changes:** A proposal to rezone a property on University Avenue from commercial to residential was tabled due to concerns about parking and density.
* **Affordable Housing:** The commission discussed the city's affordable housing strategy and heard from community members about their concerns and suggestions.

There was some contention surrounding the zoning change proposal. Commissioner Johnson expressed concerns about the impact of increased density on the neighborhood, while Commissioner Patel argued that it would bring much-needed housing stock to the area. The proposal was ultimately tabled until the next meeting for further discussion.

Additionally, the commission voted to allocate $100,000 from the city's community development block grant funds towards a new affordable housing initiative in the Frogtown neighborhood. The vote was unanimous, with all commissioners agreeing that it was a crucial step towards addressing the city's affordable housing crisis.
