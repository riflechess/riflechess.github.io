#### Summary

The meeting began with the approval of minutes from the previous Planning Commission meeting. The chair then announced that staff would take items out of order to accommodate a planning director's absence.

Tony, representing Conference in Newburgh Planning, presented the Mississippi River Critical Area Study, which aims to protect the river's natural and cultural resources through coordinated land use planning and zoning regulations. The study involves adopting new rules from 2017 and incorporating optional provisions for better resource protection. However, there are concerns about bird-safe glass requirements, with some questioning whether murka is the right geography for this issue.

The Planning Commission discussed the adoption process, which involves getting approval from the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) after passing through the commission and city council. A public hearing was scheduled for May 2nd, but Commissioner Holtz moved to release the study for public review instead.

In another matter, the commission voted to lay over a non-performing use permit application for further consideration due to updated findings. The item will be brought back in two weeks.

The meeting also touched on upcoming transportation-related items, including a new West Seventh Corridor concept and the grand opening of the Gold Line BRT. There was no old business or new business presented.

Notable discussion points included concerns about bird-safe glass requirements, the adoption process for the Mississippi River Critical Area Study, and the layover of the non-performing use permit application. The commission also discussed open meetings laws and the limitations on discussing zoning issues outside of formal meetings.
