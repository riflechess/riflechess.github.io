#### Summary

The meeting began with the approval of minutes from the previous meeting. The first item on the agenda was a recommendation for a rezone at 10 River Park Plaza from T3M to ITM, which was unanimously approved.

Next, the committee discussed an appeal of a determination of similar use for establishing a solid waste dispatch center and fleet maintenance facility at 560 Randolph Avenue. The zoning administrator had determined that the proposed use was similar in character and impact to a public works yard or maintenance facility, which is permitted in an I1 light industrial zoning district.

Commissioner Starling raised concerns about the distinction between private and public ownership, pointing out that many private entities provide public services, including transportation and waste management. Commissioner Riley argued that the proposed use was similar to other uses allowed in the zoning district and did not necessarily conflict with the comprehensive plan or small area plans.

The committee voted on the appeal, with most commissioners voting to deny it, which means they agree with the original determination of similar use by the zoning administrator. The motion passed 11-0.

Other items discussed included:

* A conditional use permit for upgrades to the unstrain infrastructure at 2145 Child's Road
* Rezoning of 635 Cleveland South from OS to T2
* Rezoning of 959 Payne Avenue from B2 to T2

The meeting concluded with a discussion of old business, including the annual report, which was accepted by the committee and will be voted on at the next meeting.

Overall, the meeting focused on zoning decisions, similar use determinations, and discussions about private versus public ownership. The vote on the appeal of the zoning administrator's decision was contentious, but ultimately passed with a unanimous vote to deny the appeal.
