#### Meeting Info
**Meeting Type:** Planning Commission Meeting
**Date/Time:** May 2nd
**Purpose:** Review of zoning proposals and public hearing on Mississippi River Critical Corridor Area Zoning Study
**Relevant Context:** This meeting is part of a series of public hearings and discussions regarding the proposed Mississippi River Critical Corridor Area Zoning Study, which aims to balance economic development with environmental protection in the riverfront area.

#### Summary

The Planning Commission Meeting began with approval of minutes from April 18th. The committee then reviewed zoning proposals, including:

* Approval of a conditional use permit for an impound lot building at 810 Barge Channel Road.
* A motion passed to approve a six-story mixed-use building at Grand and Victoria streets, with some commissioners abstaining.
* Discussion on a site plan review for the FCC environmental site at 560 Randolph Avenue, including refueling facilities and storage areas.

The meeting then shifted to public comments on the Mississippi River Critical Corridor Area Zoning Study. Speakers from various organizations and community members expressed concerns about development in the riverfront area, advocating for stronger bird-safe building standards, setbacks from the river, and repurposing existing architecture. Some speakers also noted the importance of preserving natural heritage and protecting environmental quality.

During public comments, Commissioner Riley called out that the compromise in front of them is insufficient, echoing the sentiments of some speakers who opposed the draft ordinance due to its vagueness on bird-safe standards. Commissioner Hackney agreed with Commissioner Riley's assessment, stating that the concerns brought up during public testimony are "salient and well put."

The committee then discussed a separate study on bird safe glass, with staff recommending moving forward without it initially, but considering initiating a separate study to address concerns raised during public comments.

In conclusion, the Planning Commission voted to release a study for public review, hold the record open for additional written testimony, and move forward with the zoning proposals. The next steps in the process will include review by the Comprehensive Neighborhood Planning Committee, followed by recommendations to the Mayor and City Council.
