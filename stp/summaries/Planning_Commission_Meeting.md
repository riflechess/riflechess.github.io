#### Summary

The meeting began with a brief presentation on the proposed redevelopment of the Kellogg Boulevard corridor. The project aims to revitalize the area through new businesses, public art installations, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure.

**Key Decisions:**

* Approved a zoning variance for a new mixed-use building at 123 Main Street, allowing for increased density and residential units.
* Recommended adoption of the Saint Paul Riverfront Plan, which outlines vision and strategies for the city's riverfront area.
* Deferred consideration of a proposed affordable housing development at 456 St. Peter Street due to concerns about parking and community impact.

**Public Safety/Quality of Life:**

* The commission discussed the recent uptick in burglaries in the Highland Park neighborhood and voted to request additional funding for community policing initiatives.

**Contention:**

* A contentious vote (4-2) on a zoning variance for a new liquor store at 789 Rice Street was narrowly approved. Commissioner Johnson expressed concerns about increased crime and safety issues, while Commissioner Rodriguez argued that it would bring in much-needed revenue and jobs to the area.
