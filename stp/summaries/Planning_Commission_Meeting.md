#### Summary
The meeting began with the approval of the minutes from the previous meeting. The first item discussed was a conditional use permit for an emergency housing facility at 435 University Avenue. Commissioner Tagiaff expressed concerns about the expansion from 138 to 210 beds, citing that it would not meet the district's requirement for facilities serving fewer than 16 residents. He also argued that the modification of conditions did not align with the intent and purpose of the original restriction.

Commissioner Tegahoff countered by highlighting the need for spaces to address homelessness and the facility's existing track record in the area. Commissioner Risberg, who had worked across the street from the facility, expressed support for the expansion, citing its potential benefits for community use. The vote on this item was 9-2 in favor of approval.

The next items discussed were a conditional use permit for a farmers market at Comel Park Lutheran and a utility building for US Internet. For the farmers market, there was little discussion, and it passed unanimously. For the utility building, Commissioner Riley raised concerns about the potential impact on the neighborhood node, but ultimately voted against it.

A roll call vote was held for both items, with all voting commissioners present except for one. The last item discussed was a presentation from the planning commission's intern on a new SharePoint site for accessing committee and commission materials. Commissioners asked questions about the site's functionality and organization, particularly regarding how to link to public-facing information.

The meeting concluded with a discussion on improving communication between the planning commission and other city departments, including the BZA (Board of Zoning Appeals). It was noted that there are plans to have staff brief the commission on their relationship and how they work together in the future.
