#### Summary
The meeting began with the approval of the minutes from the previous meeting on July 11th. Commissioner Syed pointed out a clerical error in the minutes regarding the mayor's office presentation on the 2025 budget, which did not occur. The minutes were subsequently corrected and approved by a vote of 4-1 (Commissioner Martinson abstaining).

The chair announced that Commissioner Kadir's last meeting was on July 25th as he will be pursuing his degree in design and urban ecologies at the New York New School.

The Zoning Committee reported three items:

* A final report on NCUP, reestablishing a non-performing commercial use general store. This item passed unanimously.
* A conditional use permit for a shelter serving up to 24 adult residents and minor children. The application included a modification of the minimum distance requirement from 20 feet to 1,037 feet. Commissioner Tagiaf mentioned that this was a unanimous decision in the Zoning Committee. The motion to adopt the software as written passed with no opposition.
* A traditional use permit for an emergency housing facility for families. This item had two options: allowing more than 16 residents or setting a limit of 60 families plus Interfaith Action living on-site for operational purposes. Commissioner Riley suggested adding language to address concerns about staffing and services provided by the shelter.

The motion to recommend approval subject to the condition that not more than 80 families are served passed with no opposition.

In other business, the Planning Commission discussed the Hamlin Midway neighborhood plan update and held a public hearing. The hearing was closed, and the record was left open until July 28th for additional written testimony.

The mayor's office presented an activity on the 2026 budget process and engagement. Commissioners participated in the exercise and were encouraged to share their feedback with the mayor's office.
