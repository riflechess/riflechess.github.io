#### Summary

The meeting began with the approval of the minutes from the previous meeting. Chair Grill then introduced the first item on the agenda, a conditional use permit request for 237 Richmond Avenue. The business owner had previously operated an auto repair shop without proper city permissions, but now wants to reestablish the non-conforming use as a concrete contractor.

Commissioner Riley argued that allowing this use would be consistent with the comprehensive plan and would provide a service benefit to the neighborhood. Commissioner Hackney countered that the business owner should have done their due diligence before operating illegally. Commissioner Risberg pointed out that the conditions proposed by the zoning committee were too weak to address the concerns raised by neighbors.

The staff recommendation was for approval, but with six additional conditions to mitigate the potential issues raised by neighbors. The motion coming out of the zoning committee was also for approval, subject to these conditions.

After discussion and questioning from various commissioners, Commissioner Riley called the question and moved forward with a vote. The motion passed with 9 votes in favor and 2 opposed (Commissioners Hackney and Ortega).

The next item on the agenda was a rezoning request for 959 Payne Avenue, which would change the zoning from B2 to T2. Commissioner Hummas expressed concerns about setting a precedent for allowing more manufacturing and hazardous chemicals in the area. However, other commissioners argued that T2 zoning is consistent with the comprehensive plan and would allow for more residential opportunities.

The motion coming out of the committee was for approval, which passed with a voice vote after discussion and questioning from various commissioners.

Finally, Chair Grill announced that the next meeting of the Planning Commission will be held on April 21st in room 40 or 41.
