#### Summary
The Planning Commission meeting covered several agenda items, including zoning changes, new development proposals, and land use policies.

**Key Decisions**

* **Zoning Changes:** The commission voted to approve a zoning change in the Frogtown neighborhood to accommodate a proposed mixed-use development. The vote was unanimous.
* **New Development Proposals:**
	+ A proposal for a new high-rise apartment building in the Downtown East neighborhood was tabled pending further review of traffic concerns.
	+ A plan for a new commercial development on University Avenue was approved, but with conditions related to parking and pedestrian access.
* **Land Use Policies:** The commission discussed and refined the city's policy on large-scale developments, aiming to balance growth with community needs.

**Controversy:**
The proposal for the high-rise apartment building in Downtown East sparked debate among commissioners. Concerns were raised about potential traffic congestion and strain on local infrastructure. Commissioner Maria Hernandez expressed strong opposition, stating that the development would "overwhelm" the neighborhood and require significant public investment to mitigate its impacts. The commission ultimately decided to table the proposal for further review.

No votes were recorded against the zoning change in Frogtown or the commercial development on University Avenue.
