#### Summary
The meeting began with a presentation from the city's planning department on proposed zoning changes in the Summit-University neighborhood. The main points of discussion included:

* Proposal to rezone several lots along Snelling Avenue to allow for higher-density development.
* Concerns raised by nearby residents about increased traffic and noise.

After public comment, the commission discussed a downtown development proposal for a new mixed-use building on the former Farmers' Market site. Key points include:

* The proposed 12-story building would include retail, office space, and 250 residential units.
* Some commissioners expressed concerns about the building's height and potential impact on nearby businesses.

The commission voted to recommend approval of the zoning changes with some modifications, including a requirement for increased stormwater management measures. However, two commissioners dissented, citing concerns about the project's density and potential strain on local infrastructure.

Regarding the downtown development proposal, the commission approved a motion to send it back to the developer with a request for additional information on building height, parking, and community benefits.
