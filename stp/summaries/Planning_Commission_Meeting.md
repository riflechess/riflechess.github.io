#### Summary

The meeting began with a discussion on approving the minutes from the previous meeting, which was approved unanimously.

The chair's announcements were brief, with no updates or announcements.

The Planning Director's Network updated the commission on recent developments, including disconnected speakers in the ceiling and efforts to establish a mobile PA system.

The zoning committee update indicated that their meeting scheduled for last week was canceled but would be rescheduled for next Thursday.

Commissioner Holtz presented an update from the Comprehensive and Neighborhood Planning Committee (CNPC), which met on May 14th. They discussed the Hamlin Midway Neighborhood Plan and a minor text amendment zoning study that passed committee unanimously.

Spencer Miller-Johnson, a planner on the Long Range team, presented the traditional neighborhood district zoning study. The study aims to modernize the 20-year-old standards in the T districts, which provide for a mix of land uses and design standards focused on pedestrian-oriented development. The proposal includes six key changes: clarifying the purpose and intent of each T district, increasing development flexibility at nodes and along corridors, adding neighborhood scale use flexibility, incentivizing affordable housing through an affordable housing density bonus, streamlining design standards by making them objective, and modernizing code language.

Commissioner Styling asked about the appropriate time for questions on the content of the study, with Commissioner Ochoa responding that discussion can occur today or at a later date. Commissioner Martinson inquired about incentives for different types of housing, including three-bedroom units, which are currently underrepresented in the city's development.

The commission then moved to consider releasing the traditional neighborhood district zoning study for public review. A motion was made by Commissioner Holtz, seconded by Commissioner Hummus, and approved unanimously with no additional discussion or opposition.

Following a brief recess, the meeting continued with staff presenting on zoning 101, explaining various types of zoning applications, including rezonings, conditional use permits, non-conforming use permits, site plans, variances, and historic use variances. The presentation covered topics such as how zoning decisions are made, who has authority over different areas of zoning, and the process for appealing administrative zoning decisions.

Staff also discussed the concept of quasi-judicial decisions, which involve applying facts and zoning standards to make a decision. Commissioners were reminded not to discuss open matters outside of meetings or engage in discussions on social media that could be considered quasi-judicial.

Additionally, staff addressed concerns about spot zoning, explaining that it is a term used to describe small plots of land with inconsistent uses, creating an island of non-conforming use within the larger zoning property. The 60-day rule was also discussed, which requires action within 60 days or the application is deemed approved by operation of law.

The meeting concluded with a discussion on staff report redesign and feedback from commissioners. Chris presented the new format for staff reports, which includes a more organized structure and easier-to-read layout. Commissioners provided feedback on the new design, suggesting that it be implemented in future meetings.

Adjournment was moved and approved at 10:00 AM.
