#### Summary
The meeting began with a review of the agenda, which included several zoning proposal reviews and public hearing items. The commission voted on two proposals:

* Zoning Proposal 1234: This proposal aimed to rezone an area in the Frogtown neighborhood from mixed-use to residential. Commissioners expressed concerns about increased density and potential parking issues. After some discussion, the proposal was approved with a 6-2 vote, with Commissioner Johnson and Commissioner Rodriguez dissenting.
* Development Project 5678: The commission reviewed plans for a new mixed-use development on the East Side. Commissioner Thompson raised questions about traffic mitigation measures, but ultimately voted in favor of the project.

Other notable items:

* A public hearing was held regarding a proposal to establish a small park in the Summit neighborhood. Neighbors expressed concerns about noise and crowding.
* The commission received an update on the city's affordable housing initiatives and discussed ways to increase funding for these programs.

Commissioner Rodriguez expressed frustration with the zoning process, stating that it can be "slow and cumbersome." Commissioner Johnson added that she would like to see more community engagement in the planning process.
