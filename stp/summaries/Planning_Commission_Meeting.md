#### Summary

The meeting began with approval of the minutes for May 16, 2025. Chair Grill then made some announcements regarding previous meetings and training sessions.

Next, the commission reviewed zoning committee reports, including a conditional use permit for a farmer's market at Rice and Larpenter and a rezoning application for a large structure at Dayton-Reuse-of-Large-Structure. Commissioner Tagiha expressed concerns about spot zoning and potential negative impacts on land value.

The commission then discussed a rezoning proposal for parcels 3, 4, and 5 at Camp's Brewery site. Commissioners had varying opinions on the matter, with some arguing that it was consistent with the comprehensive plan and others expressing concerns about spot zoning and incompatible uses. Commissioner Tagiha ultimately voted against the proposal.

The commission also discussed a minor text amendment zoning study, which had previously been approved but required formalization through a motion to initiate the study. The motion passed unanimously.

Next, the commission reviewed the Hamlin Midway D11 neighborhood plan update, which was released for public review and set a public hearing date of July 25th, 2025. A motion to release the plan for public review passed with no discussion.

The commission also discussed a commercial development district application at 1626 White Bear Avenue North. Commissioner Hummus expressed concerns about lack of residential engagement in the process, but ultimately voted in favor of recommending approval to the city council.

Finally, the commission reviewed the agenda and calendar for upcoming meetings, including transportation committee's next meeting on June 9th and planning committee's next meeting on June 11th.
