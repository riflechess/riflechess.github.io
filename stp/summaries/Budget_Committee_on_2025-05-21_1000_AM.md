#### Summary
The Budget Committee meeting focused on a draft ordinance proposal that requires reporting by amending the administrative code. The proposed language includes two main topics: budgetary reporting requirements for personnel vacancies and quarterly public safety overtime reports.

Council Member Johnson raised concerns about the lack of response from the St. Paul Police Department regarding the contingency in their overtime spending. He suggested making a formal request to address this issue, which was supported by Council President Aker and Chair Yang.

The meeting also discussed implementation timelines, with Director Wilms explaining that the administrative code is the operating manual of the city and that the proposed language would require department heads to report quarterly on personnel vacancies and overtime expenditures. 

Council Member Johnson emphasized the need for clear expectations and accountability in reporting, while Council Member Kim expressed concerns about the potential for departments to ignore requests for information.

The meeting concluded with a discussion on next steps, including further review of the draft ordinance proposal and potential revisions based on feedback from departments.
