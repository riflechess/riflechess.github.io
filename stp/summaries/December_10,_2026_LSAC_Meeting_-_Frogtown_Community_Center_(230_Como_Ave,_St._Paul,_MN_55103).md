#### Summary
The meeting began with a discussion on the proposed development of a new apartment complex in the Rondo neighborhood. The developer presented their plans for a 5-story building with 120 units, but some committee members expressed concerns about the potential impact on traffic and parking.

A motion was made to approve the project, but it failed to pass due to opposition from several committee members who felt that the city should prioritize affordable housing options over market-rate developments. The vote was 4-3 against approval, with one member abstaining.

The committee then discussed a proposal for a new community garden in the Frogtown neighborhood. After some discussion, they voted to approve a $20,000 grant from the city's Community Development Block Grant program to support the project.

Other topics discussed included:

* A proposal to rezone a property on University Avenue for commercial use
* An update on the city's affordable housing initiatives
* A report on the status of several ongoing land use projects in the city

Overall, the meeting was lively and contentious at times, but ultimately productive. The LSAC members worked together to discuss and vote on several important issues affecting the city.
