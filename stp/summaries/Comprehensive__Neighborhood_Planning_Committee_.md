The CNPC meeting on Wednesday, March 22nd, focused on reviewing the draft plan for Saint Paul's comprehensive planning process. The committee discussed and provided feedback on various sections of the plan, including transportation, land use, and housing.

Notable discussions included:

* **Transportation:** Members debated the inclusion of dedicated bus lanes in the city's downtown area. Some argued that it would improve public transportation, while others raised concerns about parking availability and potential traffic congestion.
* **Public Safety:** A resident expressed concern about increasing crime rates in certain neighborhoods and requested more resources for community policing. The committee discussed possible solutions, including increased funding for neighborhood programs and partnerships with local law enforcement.

The committee also:

* Received updates on ongoing projects related to affordable housing and urban design

A contentious point of discussion arose regarding the transportation section, where some members disagreed about the implementation of dedicated bus lanes. The motion passed with a 6-3 vote, with dissenting voices from Noecker, who argued that it would disproportionately affect local businesses.

Overall, the meeting aimed to gather input from residents and stakeholders on the comprehensive planning process. The draft plan will be revised based on feedback received during these meetings.
