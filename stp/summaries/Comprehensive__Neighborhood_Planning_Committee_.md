#### Summary
The meeting began with an introduction by the committee chair, followed by a presentation on the proposed updates to the Saint Paul Comprehensive Plan. The plan aims to address issues related to affordable housing, transportation, and community development.

Key decisions made during the meeting include:

* Approval of funding for a feasibility study on a new public park in the Dayton's Bluff neighborhood
* Discussion of zoning regulations for small businesses in the Midway area
* Review of the proposed bike-sharing program for the city

One contentious issue that arose was the proposal to rezone a property in the Summit-University neighborhood. Some committee members expressed concerns about the potential impact on local businesses and residents, while others argued that it would promote economic development and diversity.

A vote on the rezoning proposal ended with 8 votes in favor and 4 against, with 1 abstention. The matter will be brought to the Saint Paul City Council for further discussion.
