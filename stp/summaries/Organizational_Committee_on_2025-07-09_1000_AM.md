#### Meeting Info
**Meeting Type:** Organizational Committee Meeting
**Date/Time:** 2025-07-09 10:00 AM
**Purpose:** Discussion on bonding, debt management, and financial overview of the City of Saint Paul.

#### Summary

The meeting began with a discussion on bonding and debt management. The city's treasurer, Sarah Brown, explained that bonds are essentially loans taken by the city to finance large capital projects. She highlighted the importance of understanding the difference between general obligation (GO) bonds and revenue-backed bonds. GO bonds are repaid through the property tax levy, while revenue-backed bonds are repaid from specific revenue sources.

The committee discussed the city's debt profile, with a focus on its GO debt outstanding. The city has $249 million in GO bonds outstanding, with a AAA rating from S&P and Fitch. However, this is not reflected in the city's overall credit rating, which has been impacted by pension pressures and the city's debt burden.

The committee also explored the concept of "generational equity," where costs are spread over time to benefit future users of a project. This approach was seen as beneficial for capital projects with long lifespans, such as street reconstruction bonds.

Regarding public safety bonds, the committee learned that these are typically used for police and fire vehicles and have a shorter term than GO CIB bonds. The city's director noted that public safety bonds can be issued under normal GO CIB legislation, but it's often easier to do so with a larger block size.

The meeting also touched on the importance of credit ratings and their impact on borrowing costs. The city has a AAA rating from S&P and Fitch for its general obligation bonds, which translates to low borrowing costs. However, there is a cost associated with each gradation in credit rating, with a possible increase of $200,000 over an 8-year period.

In terms of debt constraints, the committee discussed the city's statutory debt limit, which stands at approximately $1.94 billion. However, this is not set in stone and can be adjusted through changes to state law or the city charter.

The meeting concluded with a discussion on copper wire theft, a growing concern for the city. Committee members expressed concerns about the lack of clear communication between departments and the need for more transparency in budget allocations for addressing this issue. They also discussed potential alternatives to copper wire, such as solar or aluminum.

Overall, the meeting provided valuable insights into the city's financial management practices, debt profile, and credit rating considerations. The discussion on copper wire theft highlighted the importance of effective communication between departments and the need for more transparency in budget allocations.
