#### Summary

The MACPD meeting at the Rondo Community Library covered various topics affecting the local community. A key discussion point was the proposal to allocate additional funding for the library's programming and events. The proposed budget increase of $10,000 was met with support from most committee members, but Alderperson Noecker expressed concerns about the cost and suggested exploring alternative funding sources.

Regarding public safety, there were reports of increased graffiti in the area, which prompted a discussion on potential solutions. Committee member Maria Hernandez suggested collaborating with local artists to create murals that would beautify the neighborhood while also addressing the issue of tagging. The idea was well-received by the committee, and a follow-up meeting will be scheduled to explore this concept further.

In other business, the committee discussed plans for the upcoming Rondo Days festival. Alderperson John Lee proposed moving the event's main stage to a different location within the library grounds to accommodate more attendees. However, some committee members expressed concerns about disrupting the library's operations and potential noise complaints from nearby residents. The proposal was tabled until further discussion.

The meeting concluded with no major disagreements or contentious votes, but the committee will continue to address these topics in future meetings.
