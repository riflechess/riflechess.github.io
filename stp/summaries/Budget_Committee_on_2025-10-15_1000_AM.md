#### Summary
Unfortunately, due to the lengthy and repetitive interruptions in the recording, there is no substantial discussion or decision made on the 2026 budget. The meeting appears to have been plagued by technical issues and non-substantive interruptions.

Given the lack of content, it's unclear what specific topics were discussed or decisions made. It's also uncertain whether any significant discussions occurred regarding public safety, quality of life, or business-related matters.

As a result, there is no notable disagreement or contentious votes to report on. However, it's worth noting that the meeting's ineffectiveness may have implications for the budgeting process and potential delays in allocating resources.

Citizens are encouraged to attend future meetings to ensure that their voices are heard and that important decisions are made in a timely and productive manner.
