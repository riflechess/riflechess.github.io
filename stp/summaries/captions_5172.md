#### Summary

The meeting started with the election of officers for the city council. Nacre was elected as the new council president, and a motion to approve was passed unanimously.

The consent agenda items were then discussed, with resolution 25-278 being approved for a liquor off-sale license denial against PZA to LLC due to multiple violations. Resolution 25-253 approving the appointments of officers to the City Council Budget Committee was also approved, with Council Member Yang taking on the role as chair and Council Vice President Kim as vice chair.

A public hearing was held for Ordinance 25-17, granting an application to rezone property at 25 George Street East from B1 Local Business to H1 Residential. However, no one testified in opposition or support, so the matter was laid over to February 19th for final adoption.

Another public hearing was held for ABZA 25-1, considering an appeal of a decision by the Board of Zoning Appeals denying four variance requests for a mixed-use development on the property at 2200 Ford Parkway. Several speakers testified against granting the variances, citing concerns about deviating from the master plan and creating a strip mall environment.

The city council then took up ABZA 25-2, considering an appeal of another decision by the Board of Zoning Appeals denying two variance requests for a commercial building on the property at Zero Creighton Avenue South. Again, several speakers testified against granting the variances, citing concerns about deviating from the master plan.

A public hearing was also held for RLHCO24-8, an appeal of a correction notice regarding parking surfaces at 493 Van Buren Avenue. The homeowners, Thomas and Renisha Nelson, testified that they had been trying to comply with city regulations but were confused by conflicting messages from zoning officials.

The council then took up several legislative hearing items, including RLH TA 25-25, which was a request to ratify a special tax assessment for property at 1689 Rainey Avenue. Council Member Johnson made a motion to waive the assessment fee, citing concerns about injustice done to the new homeowner. However, the motion failed with two votes in favor and four opposed.

Finally, the council discussed several items related to community development and outreach, including an upcoming business networking event hosted by Commissioner Mai Chong Zhang and Sherman Associates. The meeting concluded with announcements of good news from various wards, including a new county commissioner elected in Ward 5 and the reopening of Kraski Venezuelan Restaurant in Ward 2.
