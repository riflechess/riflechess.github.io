* Location: Frogtown Community Center, 230 Como Ave., St. Paul, MN 55103

#### Summary

The LSAC meeting covered several zoning proposals, including a proposal to rezone a property on Robert Street from residential to commercial use. The proposal met with some opposition from neighboring residents who expressed concerns about increased noise and traffic.

Other key issues discussed:

* A variance request for a new development on East University Avenue was approved, but with conditions to ensure proper stormwater management.
* A zoning text amendment to allow for more flexibility in mixed-use developments was discussed but no decision was made.
* The committee also reviewed a proposal to establish a community garden in the Frogtown neighborhood.

There were no contentious votes or significant disagreements among committee members. However, there was some discussion about the need for better communication and outreach to neighboring residents affected by zoning proposals.
