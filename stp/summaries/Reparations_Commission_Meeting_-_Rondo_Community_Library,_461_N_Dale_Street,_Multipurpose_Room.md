#### Summary
The Reparations Commission meeting discussed the Slavery Disclosure and Redress Ordinance, which aims to hold corporations and institutions accountable for their role in slavery and provide reparations to impacted communities. The ordinance requires entities to disclose their history of complicity in slavery and provide financial redress.

Commissioner English presented a model for the ordinance, which includes greater disclosure requirements, mandatory statement of financial redress, and civil enforcement mechanisms. The ordinance also provides a framework for municipalities to engage in corporate social responsibility and promote good corporate citizenship.

The commission discussed the importance of addressing unjust enrichment and holding entities accountable for their historical actions. Commissioner English referenced a 2014 lawsuit against Norfolk Southern Railroad, which had to disclose its ties to slavery after building a rail yard on city-owned land.

The meeting also touched on the tobacco industry's liability for health issues caused by smoking, drawing an analogy between the two cases. The speaker emphasized that governments have a responsibility to hold entities accountable and ensure that they engage in disclosure and redress.

The commission is considering implementing this ordinance in St. Paul, with some members expressing hope for "redress actions" coming out of the city. However, no specific decisions or votes were taken during the meeting.
