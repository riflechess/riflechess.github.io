**Date/Time:** [Insert Date and Time]

#### Summary
The Reparations Commission meeting was attended by city officials, community members, and advocates. The main agenda item was the discussion of the Reparations Program's budget allocation for 2023.

* The commission discussed allocating $1 million from the city's general fund to support reparations initiatives.
* A proposal to establish a community land trust to preserve affordable housing in historically marginalized neighborhoods was presented but did not receive a vote.

A contentious topic emerged when Commissioner Thompson raised concerns about the lack of representation from African American communities in the reparations process. This led to a 10-minute discussion, with some members arguing that the commission's diversity was sufficient and others calling for more involvement from community groups. The issue remains unresolved.

The meeting concluded without a final vote on the budget allocation, as it was decided to table the proposal until the next meeting.
