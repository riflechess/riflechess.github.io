**Location:** Rondo Community Library, 461 N Dale Street, Multipurpose Room

#### Summary
The meeting began with an overview of the commission's work on reparations efforts. Key topics discussed included:

* Update on the city's reparations plan: The commission reviewed a draft of the plan, which includes proposals for economic development, education, and community programs.
* Budget allocations: The commission voted to allocate $500,000 from the city's budget to support reparations initiatives.
* Community engagement: The commission discussed strategies for engaging with community members, including town halls and focus groups.

A contentious discussion arose regarding the allocation of funds. Commissioner Thompson expressed concerns that the proposed budget was too conservative, stating "We need to think bigger about what reparations means for this city." Commissioner Lee countered, arguing that the current proposal was a good starting point and would allow for more targeted initiatives. The vote on allocating $500,000 passed with 5 votes in favor and 2 against.

The commission also heard from community members, including testimony from individuals affected by historic redlining practices in Saint Paul. This input will inform future decisions on reparations initiatives.

No further action items were added to the agenda, but the commission is expected to reconvene soon to discuss implementation details of the reparations plan.
