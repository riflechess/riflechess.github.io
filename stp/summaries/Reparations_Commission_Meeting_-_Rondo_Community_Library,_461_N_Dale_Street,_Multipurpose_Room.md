#### Summary

The meeting focused on discussing the city's reparations plan for the Rondo community. The commission presented an update on their findings and recommendations.

Key decisions:

* The commission recommended allocating $500,000 in funding to establish a Rondo Legacy Fund, which will provide support for community-led projects and initiatives.
* A subcommittee was established to explore the possibility of creating a reparations center or museum in the Rondo neighborhood.
* The commission discussed the importance of including the voices and perspectives of Rondo residents in the decision-making process.

A contentious discussion arose regarding the allocation of funds. Some members argued that the $500,000 allocated for the Rondo Legacy Fund was too low, given the scope of the project. Others expressed concerns about diverting funds away from other community projects. The vote to approve the funding was unanimous, but with some reservations.

The meeting also touched on issues related to public safety and quality of life in the Rondo neighborhood. Residents shared concerns about crime rates and lack of resources for mental health support. The commission acknowledged these concerns and committed to working with local organizations to address them.

A notable moment of contention arose during a discussion about the role of law enforcement in the reparations process. Some members argued that the police department should have a seat at the table, while others pushed back against what they saw as a "colonizing" influence. The debate highlighted the complexities and challenges of addressing systemic racism within institutions.
