#### Summary
The meeting began with an overview of the commission's progress since its inception. The main agenda items included discussion on the proposed reparations framework for the Rondo community.

Key decisions:

* The commission agreed to allocate $500,000 from the city's budget towards reparative measures in the Rondo neighborhood.
	+ Some commissioners expressed concerns about the amount being insufficient and requested further discussion on potential sources of additional funding.
	+ Commissioner Johnson argued that any allocation should be directly tied to tangible projects benefiting community members, while Commissioner Rodriguez emphasized the need for systemic changes rather than just band-aid solutions.

A contentious point arose when discussing the role of reparations in addressing ongoing issues such as police brutality and racial profiling. Some commissioners advocated for more direct action and support for community-based initiatives, while others focused on policy reforms and partnerships with law enforcement agencies.

Additionally, a proposal to establish an independent review committee to oversee reparative efforts was met with mixed reactions:

* Commissioner Garcia highlighted the importance of transparency and community involvement in decision-making processes.
* Commissioner Patel raised concerns about duplication of effort and potential bureaucratic hurdles in implementing such a committee.

Overall, the meeting emphasized the need for further discussion and collaboration between commissioners and stakeholders. The next steps will be determined through ongoing conversations and public engagement.
