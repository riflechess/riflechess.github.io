#### Summary

The meeting focused on potential reparations for the Rondo community. Commission members discussed various proposals, including:

* Creating a community land trust to preserve affordable housing
* Establishing a community fund for economic development and social programs
* Providing scholarships and educational opportunities for Rondo residents
* Developing a memorial or public art project to acknowledge the freeway's impact

The commission also heard from community members who shared their personal stories of displacement and loss due to the freeway construction. Some attendees expressed concerns about the pace of progress, feeling that the city was moving too slowly.

A contentious discussion arose regarding the allocation of funds for reparations. Commissioner Maria Rodriguez proposed allocating 10% of the city's budget towards reparations, while Commissioner John Lee suggested a more incremental approach, starting with smaller grants and projects. The proposal did not reach consensus, with several commissioners expressing concerns about the financial burden on taxpayers.

The commission agreed to continue discussing reparations proposals and will hold further meetings in the coming weeks.
