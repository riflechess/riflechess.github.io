**Location:** Rondo Community Library, 461 N Dale Street, Multipurpose Room

#### Summary

The meeting focused on ongoing efforts to provide reparations to the Rondo community, which was disproportionately affected by the 1968 urban unrest. Commission members presented an update on their work, including:

* A proposed budget for fiscal year 2024: $500,000, with allocations for:
	+ Community-based initiatives ($200,000)
	+ Education and job training programs ($150,000)
	+ Economic development projects ($100,000)
	+ Infrastructure improvements ($50,000)
* Discussion on potential new initiatives, including a community land trust and affordable housing programs
* Reports from subcommittees on issues such as education, economic empowerment, and health

A contentious debate arose during the discussion of budget allocations. Commissioner Thompson expressed concerns that the allocated funds for community-based initiatives were too narrow in scope, potentially limiting opportunities for grassroots innovation. Commissioner Patel countered that the commission's goal was to provide concrete support for proven programs, rather than investing in speculative ventures.

The commission voted 6-2 to approve the proposed budget, with Commissioners Thompson and Rodriguez dissenting due to concerns about the allocation of funds.
