#### Summary

The meeting begins with an acknowledgement of the transatlantic slave trade and its impact on communities of color. The Reparations Commission then moves on to approve last month's meeting minutes, which was motioned by Commissioner Robinson and seconded by another commissioner.

The next agenda item is a discussion on the listening session that took place recently. Approximately 16-20 individuals participated in the session, with some sharing their thoughts and feelings about reparations. However, it seems that the commission had hoped for more solutions-oriented contributions from attendees.

Commissioner [Last Name] mentions that they met with Council Member Nika Bowie to discuss potential partnerships between the Reparations Commission and the city council. They also mention a meeting with Unity Church regarding a potential donation of $100,000 for harm report research and other commission needs.

The commission then discusses an update on the registrative process, including partnerships with libraries and archives. Commissioner [Last Name] mentions that they have been in contact with the St. Paul Club Library to create a more comprehensive registry of reparations-related resources.

The majority of the meeting is spent discussing a report on African American Redress Network, which includes data on Black Minnesotans and their experiences with poverty rates, homeownership, and debt. The report highlights the unique challenges faced by different Black communities in Minnesota.

Overall, the meeting appears to focus on discussions regarding partnerships, research, and community engagement, rather than making significant decisions or taking action towards reparations.
