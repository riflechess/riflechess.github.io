#### Summary
The Reparations Commission Meeting focused on three key areas: housing development, education initiatives, and economic empowerment. 

* Housing Development:
	+ The commission voted to allocate $1 million for a new affordable housing project in the Rondo neighborhood.
	+ Commissioner Thompson expressed concern about the potential gentrification of the area, but other commissioners argued that the project would help retain existing residents while providing affordable options for new families.
* Education Initiatives:
	+ The commission approved a proposal to establish a community-led educational program focusing on the history and culture of the Rondo neighborhood.
	+ Commissioner Rodriguez suggested adding more resources for youth programs, which was met with support from other commissioners but no additional funding was allocated at this meeting.
* Economic Empowerment:
	+ The commission discussed potential partnerships with local businesses to create job training programs and provide economic opportunities for residents.
	+ A heated debate emerged regarding the role of city government in supporting small businesses versus large corporations. Commissioner Patel argued that the city should prioritize supporting existing small businesses, while Commissioner Lee countered that partnering with larger corporations could bring more resources and jobs to the area.

A motion to establish a community land trust was put forward by Commissioner Rodriguez but did not pass due to lack of support from the rest of the commission. The Reparations Commission will revisit this proposal at their next meeting.
