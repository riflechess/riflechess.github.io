#### Summary

The meeting began with a welcome and introduction of new Commissioner Markeia Connors. Chair Cruz then discussed the roles and responsibilities of the commission and staff, highlighting the importance of clear communication and coordination.

The main topics of discussion were:

* The listening session: The commission will be hosting a community listening session on June 12th to gather input from residents on reparations. Commissioner Pickett suggested that all commissioners attend, while others recommended providing advance notice and ensuring that it is clearly labeled as a listening session rather than a meeting.
* Reparations report: Research in Action and the African American Redress Network have submitted their scope of work and proposals for partnerships with the commission. The subcommittee has drafted recommendations to send to the City Council, but there was some confusion about whether these recommendations require full-body approval or can be sent from the subcommittee.
* RFP (Request for Proposal) process: The procurement department will guide the commission through the RFP process, and updates will be provided as needed.
* Commission vacancies: Two openings need to be filled due to Commissioner Pickett's resignation and a new commissioner who has moved to Minneapolis.

The meeting concluded with no other business before adjournment.
