#### Summary
The meeting began with an introduction from the chair, who acknowledged the historical trauma experienced by communities of color in Saint Paul. The commission heard testimony from community members on the ongoing effects of redlining, gentrification, and other forms of systemic racism.

Key decisions:

* The commission voted to allocate $500,000 to establish a reparations fund for descendants of Rondo community residents who were displaced during the construction of I-94.
* A proposal to create a community land trust was tabled due to concerns about feasibility and potential unintended consequences.

Notable moments of contention:
* Commissioner Johnson expressed concern that the reparations fund would be insufficient to address the scale of the problem, leading to a 4-3 vote on the allocation amount. Commissioners Rodriguez and Hernandez advocated for a larger allocation, arguing that it was essential to address the historical injustices.
* Commissioner Lee suggested that the community land trust proposal could be reworked to prioritize affordable housing development in the Rondo area, but this idea was met with resistance from other commissioners who felt it strayed too far from the original purpose of the meeting.
