#### Meeting Info

**Attendees:** Council President Noecker, Council Members Bowie, Coleman, Jost, Kim, Johnson

#### Summary
The meeting began with a presentation by Mr. Nagelic from the Department of Safety Inspections (DSI) on updates to the TNCs licensing ordinance. The proposed changes aim to refine compliance enforcement models and recognize the growing number of businesses in the market. Key points include:

* Random unannounced inspections through the app
* Verification of driver's criminal history checks
* Significant decrease in license fees for transportation network companies
* Elimination of February-only insurance dates

The committee also heard from Marie Domenia, founder and CEO of Move, a locally founded rideshare company. She expressed support for the tiered fee structure and highlighted the importance of safety and community engagement.

Next, Bill Dermody presented on the drive-thru ordinances in Saint Paul. He discussed the problems associated with drive-thrus, including unsafe pedestrian access, non-pedestrian-oriented streetscapes, noise, litter, behavior, health impacts, and pollution. The Planning Commission is recommending prohibiting new restaurant and coffee shop drive-thrus while allowing pharmacies and banks to have them.

The committee raised several questions and concerns, including the financial impact on existing businesses, the potential for a ban on drive-thrus in certain areas, and the need for a balance between pedestrian-friendly development and convenience for residents. Council Members Yang and Coleman expressed their thoughts on the issue, highlighting the importance of considering the needs of different communities and ensuring that any policy changes do not disproportionately affect low-income or marginalized groups.

The meeting concluded with no action taken, but the committee agreed to continue discussing the issues raised during the presentation.
