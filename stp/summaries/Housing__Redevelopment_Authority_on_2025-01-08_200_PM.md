#### Summary

The meeting covered several key topics related to the Housing Redevelopment Authority (HRA) projects and initiatives for 2025. Some of the notable points include:

* The approval of a resolution to declare surplus property at the Ham site, which is necessary to release the land from state general obligation bond grant obligations.
* A staff report on the HRA's preview of 2025, which included an update on various programs and initiatives, such as the Commercial Corridors Program, Emergency Rental Assistance and Eviction Prevention Program, and Healthy Homes and Power of Home.
* The implementation of the downtown investment strategy, which includes supporting legislation around office-to-housing conversions and arena renovations.
* The development of a dashboard to track housing data and affordability in St. Paul, in partnership with the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.
* A discussion on the citywide economic development strategy, including a comprehensive analysis of local economy strengths and weaknesses, setting goals for economic growth, and developing workforce skills.
* Updates on major development sites and master plans, including the United Village project and the downtown plan.
* The release of an RFP for the HRA's mini parking ramps, to introduce competition among operators and improve pricing.

Some areas of contention or disagreement included:

* Commissioner Necker expressed concerns about "study creep," where a study tries to fix all problems at once, rather than focusing on specific recommendations.
* Commissioner Jalali emphasized the need for urgency in addressing economic factors outside of the city's control, such as federal tariffs and policy changes.

The meeting concluded with a discussion on future presentations and topics for the HRA meetings, including the housing policy study. The next meeting is scheduled for January 22, 2025.
