#### Summary

The Neighborhood Safety Community Council meeting on September 10, 2025, focused on enhancing community safety in Saint Paul. The key topics discussed were:

* **Community Policing Efforts**: Representatives from the Saint Paul Police Department presented updates on community policing initiatives, including increased foot patrols and neighborhood outreach programs.
* **Budget Allocation**: The council reviewed the city's budget allocation for public safety and made recommendations for future allocations.

A contentious discussion arose regarding the proposal to establish a Community Safety Task Force. Some members argued that it would be an effective way to address community concerns and provide a platform for dialogue between residents, law enforcement, and city officials. However, others expressed concerns about the potential duplication of efforts and the need for more concrete solutions to address rising crime rates.

The vote on establishing the Community Safety Task Force was 7-3 in favor, with Council Members Rodriguez, Johnson, and Lee opposing the proposal due to concerns about its feasibility and effectiveness.
