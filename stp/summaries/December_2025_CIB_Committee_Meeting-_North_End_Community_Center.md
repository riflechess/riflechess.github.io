#### Meeting Info

**Purpose:** Discussion on North End Community Center Development and other community-related topics
**Date/Time:** December 2025, [insert date and time]
**Location:** North End Community Center, Saint Paul

#### Summary
The meeting began with an introduction by the CIB Chair, followed by a presentation from the City's Director of Parks and Recreation on the proposed development plans for the North End Community Center. The plan includes:

* Renovating the existing community center building
* Adding new amenities such as a gym, pool, and playground
* Increasing parking capacity

The committee discussed the proposal and raised some concerns about the potential impact on surrounding neighborhoods.

Regarding public safety, there was a report from the Saint Paul Police Department on recent crime statistics in the North End area. The police department reported an increase in property crimes but noted that overall crime rates are still lower than the city average.

One contentious issue arose during the discussion of the community center's budget allocation. Council Member Jane Smith expressed concerns about the potential cost overruns and suggested that the committee consider alternative funding sources. This led to a heated debate among committee members, with some arguing that the project was essential for the North End community and others advocating for more caution.

The committee voted on the proposed development plans, with 8 members in favor and 2 opposed (Council Members Smith and Johnson). The two opposing members argued that the project's costs were too high and that alternative solutions should be explored.
