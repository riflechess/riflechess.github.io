#### Summary

The CIB Committee met to discuss funding allocations for community centers in the North End. Key decisions included:

* Discussion on increasing security measures at the center, including camera installation and additional staffing

A contentious issue arose regarding the allocation of funds for a proposed art program. Some committee members argued that the program would be beneficial in promoting community engagement and creativity, while others expressed concerns about the program's feasibility and potential impact on existing programming. A motion to allocate $50,000 for the art program was tabled until further discussion.

No votes were taken during the meeting, as discussions were ongoing and decisions had not been finalized. The next CIB Committee meeting is scheduled for January 2026, where further deliberations will take place.
