#### Meeting Info
* **Meeting Type:** CIB (Community Investment Budget) Committee Meeting
* **Purpose:** Review and discuss community development projects in the North End neighborhood
* **Date/Time:** December 15, 2025 at 6:00 PM
* **Location:** North End Community Center

#### Summary
The CIB Committee meeting focused on reviewing proposals for community development projects in the North End. Key decisions were made regarding funding allocations.

**Approved Projects:**
* $200,000 allocated to renovate the North End playground, including new equipment and safety improvements.
* $150,000 granted to support a community garden initiative, aiming to increase access to fresh produce and green spaces.
* $100,000 earmarked for a neighborhood beautification project, focusing on graffiti removal and street art enhancements.

The only contentious issue arose during the discussion of the community garden proposal. Councilor Rodriguez expressed concerns about the potential impact on nearby property values, citing uncertainty about the long-term viability of such projects. However, this concern was largely alleviated by the project lead's assurance that regular evaluations would be conducted to assess effectiveness and make adjustments as needed.

The committee members voted unanimously in favor of the approved projects, with all funds allocated from the CIB budget.
