#### Summary

The Housing and Redevelopment Authority (HRA) meeting focused on several key topics. First, the HRA staff provided an update on the Healthy Homes and Power of Home programs. The programs aim to reduce energy costs, improve health and comfort in homes for low- and moderate-income residents, and address climate-vulnerable neighborhoods. The staff made changes to the program guidelines based on commissioner feedback, including removing rental properties, adjusting eligibility criteria, and adding specific options under Power of Home.

The meeting also discussed legislative requests for economic development funding. Ramsey County's HRA requested support from the city for a bill that would allow them to use their HRA levy towards economic programming. The bill aims to diversify industries, communities, and emerging entrepreneurs. Commissioner Nacre expressed concerns about the level of control the city would have over how the economic development dollars are spent.

In addition, Director Newton presented a draft scope for a citywide economic development strategy. The strategy aims to advance the future of residents, businesses, and nonprofits by growing the tax base and economic wealth. Key challenges and opportunities were highlighted, including housing affordability, regulatory environment, permitting process, public realm investments, and racial disparities in economic opportunity.

Commissioners provided feedback on the draft scope, emphasizing the need for a detailed plan with specific tactics and strategies. Commissioner Yang suggested that the consultant focus on streamlining the permitting process to improve development in the city. Commissioner Bowie recommended connecting with district councils and commercial corridors to gather information and input from local stakeholders.

Finally, the meeting approved resolutions to refer the Healthy Homes and Power of Home programs to the City Council for further action and to approve a modification of the 2002 home loan for the Jackson Street Village Project.
