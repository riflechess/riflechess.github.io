* **Date/Time:** [Insert Date and Time]
* **Purpose:** To discuss additional process proposals for the community center

#### Summary
The meeting began with an overview of the purpose by the moderator. The main topic was to review and provide feedback on three proposed changes to the current community center process:

1. **New Community Engagement Committee**: Establish a new committee focused on engaging local residents in decision-making processes.
2. **Community Center Space Rental**: Introduce a new rental system for private events, with revenue generated going towards center maintenance.
3. **Sustainability Initiative**: Implement sustainable practices and reduce waste within the community center.

There was some discussion around the sustainability initiative, with concerns raised about potential costs and feasibility. A few attendees questioned whether the initiative would be effective in reducing waste without additional resources.

The proposals were put to a vote, with all three passing but with some dissenting voices on the sustainability initiative.

*   **New Community Engagement Committee:** Unanimous approval
*   **Community Center Space Rental:** Unanimous approval
*   **Sustainability Initiative:** Passed 10-2, with concerns about potential costs and feasibility
