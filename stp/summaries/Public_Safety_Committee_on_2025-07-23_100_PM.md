#### Summary
The meeting started with a presentation by County Attorney John Choi on the role of the prosecutor's office in Ramsey County. He discussed the process of charging and diverting cases, as well as the use of treatment courts to address mental health and addiction issues. Choi highlighted that his office has charged around 55-65% of adult cases over the past few years, with a focus on violent crimes.

The discussion then shifted to the university Avenue corridor cases, which have seen an uptick in fifth-degree drug possession and felony assaults. Choi explained that his office has developed a case designation system to prioritize these cases and provide special attention to them.

Council Member Troy stated that he appreciates the County Attorney's Office for bringing context to the committee and for navigating the challenging role of sitting between state-level guidelines, local law enforcement, and city-level functions. Troy also mentioned that the university Avenue corridor is a critical issue, particularly with the intense fentanyl crisis affecting care-based work.

Molly Jamo from Listening House presented on the Work Now program, which aims to help people attain IDs, birth certificates, and employment. The program uses ARPA dollars to provide $20 an hour for two shifts per week, allowing participants to gain financial stability and move out of homelessness. Molly highlighted that the program has been successful in reducing stigma around people working in vests picking up trash.

Council Member Gilles asked about tax implications on the payment received by Work Now participants, with Molly explaining that it's not a W2 yet but will be considered in the next phase of programming.

The committee praised the Work Now program for its innovative approach to addressing homelessness and providing employment opportunities. Council Members expressed their support for continuing the conversation and exploring ways to expand funding for the program. The meeting concluded with appreciation for Molly's presentation and enthusiasm for the work being done by Listening House.
