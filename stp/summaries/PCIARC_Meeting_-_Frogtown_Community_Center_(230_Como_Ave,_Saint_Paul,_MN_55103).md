#### Summary

The PCIARC meeting focused on updates from the city's planning department regarding the Riverview Corridor project. Key discussion points included:

* The proposed alignment of the light rail transit line along the corridor
* Updates on the development of the Lowry Avenue and Lexington Parkway intersections
* A review of community engagement efforts to date

One area of contention was the proposal for a new transit center near the intersection of Snelling and University avenues. Some committee members expressed concerns about the potential impact on local businesses and traffic patterns.

A motion was made to recommend that the city council allocate $1 million towards community outreach and engagement initiatives related to the Riverview Corridor project. The motion passed with 10 votes in favor and 2 against, with one member abstaining. Those voting against expressed concerns about the allocation of funds without a clear plan for their use.

The committee also discussed potential zoning changes along the corridor, with some members advocating for denser development to accommodate projected population growth.
