#### Summary
The main topics discussed at the recent PCIARC meeting were:

* A new development proposal for a mixed-use building on University Avenue was presented to the commission. The proposal includes 200 units of affordable housing and commercial space. The developer is seeking tax-increment financing (TIF) to help fund the project.
* The commission reviewed an update on the city's bike-share program, which will be expanding to new locations in the city.
* A resident expressed concerns about public safety in the Frogtown neighborhood, citing increased crime rates and lack of police presence. The commissioner assured the resident that the police department is working to address these issues.

The development proposal was met with some skepticism from commissioners, who questioned the feasibility of the project's budget and the impact on traffic congestion in the area. Commissioner Rodriguez expressed concerns about the potential displacement of long-time residents due to gentrification. Commissioner Johnson argued that the affordable housing component was a positive aspect of the proposal. The commission voted 5-2 in favor of moving forward with the proposal, with Commissioners Rodriguez and Johnson dissenting.

No major decisions were made regarding budget allocations or tax proposals during this meeting.
