#### Summary

The meeting began with a discussion on the proposed development at the former Hamline United Methodist Church site. The developer is seeking approval for a 7-story mixed-use building, which has raised concerns among some community members about increased traffic and density in the area.

Key decisions made during the meeting include:

* Approving the proposed development plan for the former Hamline United Methodist Church site
* Allocating $200,000 from the city's affordable housing fund to support the development of affordable units in the new building
* Referred a request to rezone a property on University Avenue for further review due to concerns about its impact on local businesses

A contentious discussion emerged during the meeting regarding the developer's plan to increase parking fees in the area. Some community members expressed concern that this would disproportionately affect low-income residents and visitors, while others argued that it was necessary to manage traffic congestion.

The vote to approve the development plan was 7-2, with Council Members Johnson and Rodriguez dissenting due to concerns about over-development and lack of affordable housing units in the proposal.
