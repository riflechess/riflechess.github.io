#### Meeting Info
Meeting Type: Local Safety Advisory Council (LSAC) Meeting
Date/Time: October 8, 2026, evening
Location: Highland Park Library (1974 Ford Pkwy, St. Paul, MN 55116)
Purpose: Public safety discussion and community engagement


#### Summary
The meeting began with an update on the recent crime statistics in the city, highlighting a slight increase in property crimes in some areas. The chair of the council proposed the allocation of additional resources to the police department for enhanced patrols in high-crime neighborhoods.

Some attendees expressed concerns about the impact of gentrification on community policing and asked that more be done to involve long-time residents in decision-making processes.

A resolution was presented to support increased funding for community outreach programs, which was met with overwhelming approval (LSAC members present: 14-1). However, one member raised objections, arguing that more funds should go directly towards law enforcement rather than social services.


The discussion also touched on potential solutions for addressing the growing problem of abandoned vehicles in residential areas. A working group is being formed to explore options and provide recommendations.


Budget allocations were discussed, but no concrete decisions were made during this meeting. The council will reconvene in two weeks to review a revised budget proposal.

A resident expressed concern about a recent break-in at a local convenience store on Payne Avenue, which led to a brief discussion about the role of neighborhood watch groups and private security patrols.


No other significant concerns or proposals were raised during the meeting.
