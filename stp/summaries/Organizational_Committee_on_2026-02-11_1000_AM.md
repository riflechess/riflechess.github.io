#### Summary
The Organizational Committee met to review and discuss the Sober Housing Moratorium Study. Mr. Bill Dermody presented the study's findings and recommendations. The key points from the presentation include:

* The study aims to address concerns about sober houses converting to supportive housing facilities, which have different zoning requirements.
* The current code has a minimum separation distance of 330 feet between sober houses, but some have been seeking variances for larger facilities.
* The Planning Commission recommends keeping the 330-foot separation requirement and not changing it to accommodate larger facilities.
* The study also discusses the issue of large sober houses with no staffing or services, which may be allowed under current zoning regulations.
* The Planning Commission recommends creating a new registration system for sober houses and capping them at 10 residents.

The committee discussed various aspects of the report, including:

* Funding changes at the state level, which may affect how sober houses operate.
* The importance of management in supportive housing facilities, and whether the city should regulate it further.
* Clarifying definitions between sober houses and supportive housing facilities.
* The possibility of revising zoning regulations to better accommodate larger facilities.

Some notable disagreements or areas of contention include:

* Council Member Yang expressed concern about the lack of beds available for people recovering from chemical dependency and suggested revisiting funding changes at the state level.
* There was some discussion about whether to change the terms used in city code to align with the state's new terminology, but ultimately no decision was made.

Overall, the committee appeared to support the Planning Commission's recommendations, which aim to clarify zoning regulations and prevent abuses of the system. However, further debate and discussion are expected at future meetings.
