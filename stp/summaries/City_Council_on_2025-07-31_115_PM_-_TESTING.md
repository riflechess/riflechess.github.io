#### Summary

The Grow Downtown Program aims to match entrepreneurs from the local community with vacant storefronts in downtown Saint Paul. This program is part of an effort to revitalize the area and provide a unique shopping experience for residents and visitors. The initiative focuses on creating a vibrant, in-person atmosphere that encourages people to explore and support local businesses.

The meeting did not cover any significant decisions or contentious issues due to its testing nature. As this was a test session, there were no actual discussions, votes, or actions taken by the City Council.
