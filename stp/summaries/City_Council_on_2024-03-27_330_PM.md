The meeting began with the adoption of the consent agenda items 4 through 17. Item 16 was a resolution commemorating the observance of Ramadan 2024 and its significance to Muslims in St. Paul. The council heard from Imam Hassan, Dr. Abdus Samet Lujan, and other community leaders, who expressed gratitude for the city's recognition of their faith and culture.

Item 17 recognized Brittany Baker as the first black woman captain in the St. Paul Fire Department. Captain Baker shared a powerful poem about her journey and the importance of representation in public service. The resolution was adopted unanimously.

The meeting also discussed various ordinances, including one related to electric vehicle charging infrastructure in surface parking lots. Staff presented a zoning study that recommended allowing 80% of parking spaces in new surface parking facilities with more than 15 parking spaces to be EV-capable.
