#### Summary
The meeting began with a roll call, with all seven council members present. The consent agenda was approved without discussion. Resolution 25-801, memorializing a city council decision to grant the appeal of Brian Pierce from a planning commission decision, was approved with some debate.

The public hearing on Ordinance 25-32, considering the application of Matt Kennevan to rezone property at 959 Payne Avenue, was continued until May 21st. The hearing on Resolution 25-62, approving the application of Breakaway Music Festival for a sound level variance, saw some discussion and debate before being approved.

Council Member Johnson expressed concerns about the sound levels requested by Breakaway Music Festival, comparing them to previous festivals in the city. Council Member Provovsky explained that the changes made this year were significant, including relocating the main stage and adjusting the hours.

The council also discussed Resolution 25-86, authorizing the police department to accept a $235,000 state homeland security grant for a boat to be used by the ordinance disposal unit. The grant will enable the unit to respond to underwater hazardous device mitigation incidents on the Mississippi River.

The city council approved several resolutions related to tax increment financing (TIF) and redevelopment agreements, including one for the Highland Bridge site. Council Member Yang expressed concerns about the changes made to the agreement, including a reduction in the number of units proposed from 2,000 to 1,200.

Council Member Provovsky explained that the changes were necessary due to market conditions and that the project would still provide affordable housing options. Council Member Johnson recommended delaying the vote on the TIF agreement for two weeks to allow more time for discussion and review.

The council also discussed several other items related to development agreements and tax assessments, including one involving a vacant building on 736 Oakdale Avenue. The owners of the building testified that they had encountered difficulties with the Department of Safety and Inspections (DSI), which led to delays in getting permits and assessments.

Council Member Johnson recommended reducing the assessment fee for the building from $1,300 to $650, taking into account both DSI's error and the impact it had on when construction could occur. The recommendation was approved by a 7-0 vote.
