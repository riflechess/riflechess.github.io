#### Summary
The meeting began with a welcome to new council member Bratsky and a celebration of National Library Week. The first item on the agenda was the approval of minutes from the previous meeting, which was approved unanimously.

The second item was a presentation by Callie Freeman and Ben Loving about the Rondo Frogtown Loop, a collaborative network between libraries and recreation centers in Ward 1 to provide transportation and access to programs for young people. The loop has been funded by a state grant and is expected to be a sustainable program even after the grant expires.

Council Members Provoskie and Renegar asked questions about the cost of the loop and its potential expansion to other wards in the city. Council Member Bowie expressed enthusiasm for the program and suggested that it could be shared with other cities as a model for collaboration between libraries and recreation centers.

The final item on the agenda was a presentation by Library Director Hartman on the 2026 library priorities and needs assessment. Director Hartman presented an overview of the library's goals, challenges, and initiatives, including the transformation of library buildings to meet current and future needs, the development of safety specialists, and the importance of literacy in the community.

Council Members Paratsky and Nacre asked questions about the circulation cost of e-books versus physical materials and the impact of federal funding on libraries. Council Member Bowie expressed concern about staff support and the need for a safe and welcoming space for library patrons.

The meeting ended with a discussion of the importance of libraries in the community, particularly in terms of providing access to resources and programs for young people. The council members thanked Director Hartman and her staff for their presentation and expressed enthusiasm for the library's initiatives.
