#### Summary
The HREEOC meeting began with a discussion on the proposed renovation of the historic Grand Avenue district. The committee reviewed plans to restore the facades of several buildings, which sparked some debate among members.

* Key decisions:
	+ The committee approved funding for the facade restoration project, allocating $200,000 from the city's historic preservation fund.
	+ A proposal to create a pedestrian-friendly plaza in front of a new mixed-use development was tabled until further review.
* Notable discussions:
	+ Some committee members expressed concerns about the potential impact of increased foot traffic on local businesses and residents.
	+ Others argued that the project would enhance the area's aesthetic appeal and boost economic activity.

A vote to allocate funds for the facade restoration project passed with a 6-2 margin, with two members dissenting due to concerns about the project's scope and budget. The committee will reconvene in January to review further proposals related to historic preservation and economic development.
