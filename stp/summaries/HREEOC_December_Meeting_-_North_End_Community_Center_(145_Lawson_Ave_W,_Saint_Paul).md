* A proposal to establish a historic district in the Dayton's Bluff neighborhood was discussed. While some members expressed concerns about the potential impact on property values, others saw it as an opportunity to preserve the area's unique character. The vote on establishing the district was 4-2 in favor, with Commissioners Johnson and Thompson opposing.

In other business, Commissioner Patel raised concerns about the lack of affordable housing options in the city's historic districts. While some members acknowledged the issue, others felt that it was outside the scope of HREEOC's responsibilities.

The commission also discussed a potential partnership with the Saint Paul Chamber of Commerce to promote historic preservation and redevelopment efforts in the city. This proposal is expected to be explored further at the next meeting.
