The meeting started with a roll call and adoption of the consent agenda. The council then moved on to discussing various items, including:

* Ordinance 24-5, which amends Chapter 63 of the Legislative Code pertaining to electric vehicle charging infrastructure in surface parking lots. This ordinance was adopted after some discussion about balancing climate resilience and small business needs.
* Ordinance 24-12, which rezones property at 964 Payne Avenue from H2 Residential to B2 Community Business. This ordinance was also adopted.
* Item 15, which is a first reading of Ordinance 24-13, granting the application of Project for Pride and Living to rezone property at 892 East 7th Street from B3 General Business to T3 Traditional Neighborhood. A staff report was given by Chris Hong, who explained that the proposed development would be a mixed-use building with many affordable units.
* Item 16, which is a public hearing on Ordinance 24-10, amending Chapter 293 of the Legislative Code to allow certain events to obtain one amplified sound permit for multiple days. The public hearing was closed after no one spoke in opposition.
* Item 17, which is also a public hearing, on rezoning property at 1984 Marshall Avenue from RM1 multiple family residential to RM2 multiple family residential. Several community members spoke against the rezoning, citing concerns about density and spot zoning.

The council then moved on to discussing Item 18, Resolution Public Hearing 24-76, adopting the update to the St. Paul Bicycle Plan as an addendum to the St. Paul Comprehensive Plan. Jimmy Shoemaker gave a staff report explaining that the bicycle plan is being updated to include more separated bikeways and better maintenance guidance.

The public hearing on the bicycle plan was then opened, with several community members speaking in support of the plan. They highlighted the benefits of increased safety, reduced traffic congestion, and improved air quality. Some speakers also mentioned concerns about maintenance and funding.

The council then moved on to discussing Item 23, which is a preliminary plat approval for the Heights Habitat for Humanity Blocks 3 and 4. A community member spoke against the project, citing concerns about property values, traffic, and lack of parking. The applicant, Twin Cities Habitat for Humanity, explained that the development would meet setback requirements and provide more affordable housing.

The council also discussed several other items, including a grant application from J&L Wirecloth LLC and a preliminary plat approval for the Heights Habitat for Humanity Blocks 3 and 4.
