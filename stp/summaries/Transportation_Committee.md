### Summary
The Transportation Committee met to discuss various projects and policies related to transportation infrastructure in Saint Paul. Key topics included:

* **Riverfront Bike Path Extension**: The committee voted to allocate $1 million from the city's capital budget for the extension of the bike path along the Mississippi River.
* **Highway 52 Reconstruction**: Representatives from MnDOT presented an update on the reconstruction project, which is expected to be completed by summer 2024.
* **Public Transit Funding**: The committee discussed a proposal to increase funding for public transit in Saint Paul. While there was some debate about the need for increased funding, the proposal ultimately passed with a vote of 5-2.

A contentious issue arose when Councillor Johnson expressed concerns that the proposed bike path extension would displace local businesses and residents. However, other committee members argued that the project would bring economic benefits to the area and improve quality of life for residents. The debate was intense, but ultimately, the vote in favor of allocating funds for the extension carried.

A public comment period was held at the end of the meeting, during which several attendees spoke about concerns related to traffic congestion and pedestrian safety along Highway 52. The committee members took note of these comments and promised to revisit the issue at a future meeting.
