#### Summary
The Transportation Committee meeting began with a review of current transportation projects, including the proposed bike lane expansion on University Avenue. The committee discussed and voted on several items:

* **Bike Lane Expansion:** Unanimously approved the expansion of bike lanes on University Avenue, with an estimated budget of $1.2 million.
* **Traffic Signal Modernization:** Approved a plan to modernize traffic signals at 10 intersections citywide, with a total budget of $750,000.
* **Light Rail Transit (LRT) Expansion:** Discussed but did not vote on the proposed LRT expansion to the eastern part of the city.

The committee also received updates on several ongoing projects, including the improvement of the Mississippi River bike trail and the implementation of intelligent transportation systems.

A point of contention arose during the discussion of the proposed LRT expansion. Some committee members expressed concerns about the potential impact on local businesses and residents, while others argued that it would improve public safety and reduce congestion. However, no formal vote was taken on this item.

The next Transportation Committee meeting is scheduled for April 11, 2023.
