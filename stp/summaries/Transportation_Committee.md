#### Summary
The Transportation Committee meeting discussed several key topics regarding the city's infrastructure and transportation systems.

One of the main points of discussion was the proposed bike lane expansion on Kellogg Boulevard. The committee voted in favor of allocating an additional $500,000 to support this project. This decision was met with some opposition from Nacre (Noecker), who expressed concerns about the impact on local businesses and parking.

The committee also discussed a proposal to increase funding for the city's public transportation system. After a lengthy discussion, the motion to allocate an extra $750,000 to improve bus service was approved by a vote of 8-2, with Nacre and Councilor Rodriguez voting against it.

Additionally, the committee heard a presentation from the Saint Paul Police Department regarding traffic safety initiatives in the city. The department reported a significant decrease in traffic-related incidents since implementing new speed cameras and enforcement measures.

The meeting concluded with a discussion on potential solutions to alleviate congestion in the downtown area. Committee members proposed exploring alternative modes of transportation, such as ride-sharing services or carpooling incentives.
