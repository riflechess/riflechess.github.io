#### Summary
The meeting began with a review of ongoing projects, including the construction of a new bike path along Grand Avenue. The committee discussed potential improvements to pedestrian safety on Selby Avenue, proposing additional crosswalks and improved lighting.

A key topic of discussion was the proposal for a Community Benefit District (CBD) in the Summit-University neighborhood. Supporters argued that the CBD would provide additional funding for local businesses and services, while opponents expressed concerns about increased taxes and gentrification.

The committee also discussed proposed changes to the city's snow removal policy, aiming to improve efficiency and reduce costs. A motion was made to allocate $250,000 from the city budget for new snowplow equipment, which passed with a 6-2 vote.

One contentious issue arose when a citizen expressed concerns about the potential for increased traffic congestion due to the proposed CBD. The committee chair acknowledged these concerns and promised to explore ways to mitigate them.

The meeting concluded with a discussion of upcoming events, including a Bike-to-Work Day event planned for May.
