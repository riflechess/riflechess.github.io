#### Summary
The Transportation Committee meeting focused on three main topics:

* Proposed Bike Lane Improvements:
	+ The committee discussed expanding bike lanes on Summit Avenue and West Seventh Street.
	+ Some members expressed concerns about parking restrictions, while others argued that increased bike traffic would improve air quality and public health.
* Streetlight Upgrades:
	+ The city proposed upgrading streetlights in high-crime areas to LED lights, which would be more energy-efficient and secure.
	+ A few committee members questioned the cost-effectiveness of this proposal.
* Public Transportation Initiatives:
	+ The committee reviewed a plan for improved bus service frequency on select routes.
	+ Members debated whether increased funding should come from general taxation or private sponsorships.

A notable point of contention arose during the discussion on bike lane improvements. Committee member, Rachel Johnson, argued that limiting parking would negatively impact local businesses, while others countered that increased foot traffic and bike usage would drive business growth and community engagement.

The committee voted 5-2 in favor of advancing the bike lane proposals for further review. However, some members expressed reservations about implementing changes without more comprehensive public input.
