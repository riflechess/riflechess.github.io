#### Summary

The meeting began with an update on the proposed bike-share program, which is set to launch in May. The plan includes installing bike racks and stations throughout the city, with a focus on neighborhoods with limited transportation options.

A discussion followed regarding the 2023 road maintenance budget. The committee approved allocating $1.2 million for pothole repair and paving projects. Some members expressed concern that this amount may not be sufficient to address the city's extensive network of roads.

A contentious issue arose during the discussion on pedestrian safety. Commissioner Nacre (corrected from "Nacre") argued for increased funding for traffic calming measures, such as speed bumps and narrowed lanes. However, Council Member Sanchez opposed this proposal, citing concerns about increased congestion and potential harm to local businesses. The committee ultimately voted 5-3 in favor of allocating $500,000 for pedestrian safety initiatives.

The meeting concluded with a discussion on the proposed expansion of the Hiawatha Light Rail line. The project is expected to improve connectivity between downtown Saint Paul and surrounding neighborhoods. While some attendees expressed support for the plan, others raised concerns about potential disruptions to local traffic patterns during construction.
