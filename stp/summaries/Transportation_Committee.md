#### Summary
The Transportation Committee meeting began with an update on the upcoming I-35W reconstruction project. The committee discussed potential impacts on traffic flow and pedestrian safety in surrounding neighborhoods.

Key decisions:

* Approved a resolution to allocate $500,000 from the city's capital budget to improve lighting along Summit Avenue.
* Voted 6-2 to support a proposal to install bus-only lanes on University Avenue, with some members expressing concerns about parking availability and potential impacts on local businesses.
	+ Dissent: Commissioner Johnson (D-Ward 5) and Commissioner Thompson (I-Ward 3), who argued that the proposal would disproportionately affect small business owners and residents in their respective wards.

Other topics:
