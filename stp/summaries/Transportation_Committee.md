#### Summary

The meeting began with a brief overview of the agenda, which included updates on several transportation projects and initiatives.

* The committee approved funding for the reconstruction of University Avenue, with an estimated cost of $10 million. This project aims to improve traffic flow and pedestrian safety.
* A proposal to increase parking fees in downtown Saint Paul was met with opposition from some business owners, who argued that it would drive away customers and hurt local commerce. The committee ultimately voted 4-2 in favor of the fee increase, with Committee Chair, Maria Hernandez, citing the need for revenue generation to support transportation infrastructure.
* A plan to improve bike lanes on Summit Avenue was discussed, with several residents expressing concerns about safety and traffic congestion.

The discussion on bike lanes became contentious when a resident, Mark Thompson, argued that adding more bike lanes would lead to increased traffic and parking issues. However, Committee member, John Lee, countered that the bike lanes would actually improve traffic flow by reducing congestion caused by parked cars.

Overall, the meeting focused on addressing transportation needs and infrastructure in Saint Paul.
