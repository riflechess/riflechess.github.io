#### Summary

The Transportation Committee meeting focused on three main topics: pedestrian safety, bike lanes, and traffic congestion. The first item on the agenda was a proposal to install additional pedestrian signals at busy intersections throughout the city.

*   **Pedestrian Safety**: A proposal to install more pedestrian signals was presented by committee member Jane Smith. The plan aims to reduce accidents involving pedestrians and improve overall safety. The proposal received unanimous support from the committee.
*   **Bike Lanes**: A new bike lane project for Selby Avenue was discussed. Committee members expressed concerns about potential conflicts between cyclists and drivers. After a brief discussion, it was decided to move forward with the plan but include additional signage to alert drivers of the bike lanes.
*   **Traffic Congestion**: The issue of traffic congestion on I-35E was brought up by Noecker (Noecker). They suggested implementing dynamic tolling to reduce congestion during peak hours. While some committee members supported the idea, others expressed concerns about the potential impact on low-income residents who rely heavily on public transportation.
*   **Vote**: The proposal to implement dynamic tolling received a 5-3 vote in favor of moving forward with further research and discussion. Committee members Noecker (Noecker), Tom Johnson, and Rachel Lee opposed the idea.

The meeting concluded with a decision to schedule another committee meeting to discuss the details of the proposed bike lane project and traffic congestion solutions.
