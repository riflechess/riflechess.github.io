The Transportation Committee met to discuss several key projects and proposals for the city. Here are some of the main points from the meeting:

* The committee approved the construction of a new bike lane along the Mississippi Riverfront, which will connect several popular bike trails in the area.
	+ This project has been a contentious issue among residents, with some expressing concerns about traffic congestion and parking availability.
* The city is planning to allocate $1.2 million for road improvement projects on St. Peter Street and Rice Street, including resurfacing and repairs to sidewalks and curbs.
	+ Committee members discussed the importance of prioritizing road maintenance to prevent further damage and ensure public safety.
* A proposal to install pay-parking meters in downtown Saint Paul was met with mixed reactions from committee members. While some saw it as a necessary revenue-generating measure, others expressed concerns about potential negative impacts on local businesses.
	+ A vote on the proposal was tabled until the next meeting to allow for further discussion and input from stakeholders.

A notable moment of contention arose when a resident spoke out against the Riverfront Bike Lane Plan, citing concerns about increased traffic congestion and parking availability. The committee chair encouraged residents to share their feedback and suggested that a public forum be held in the coming weeks to address these concerns.
