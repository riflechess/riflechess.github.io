The Transportation Committee discussed several key topics:

* **Budget Allocation**: The committee allocated $1.2 million for the upcoming year to improve pedestrian infrastructure in high-traffic areas.
* **Bus Route Changes**: A proposal to adjust bus routes on Selby Avenue and Snelling Avenue was tabled due to concerns from local business owners about potential impacts on their customers.
* **Bicycle Lane Expansion**: The committee voted 6-3 in favor of expanding bicycle lanes on Summit Avenue, with some members expressing concerns about increased congestion.

There was a lengthy discussion about the proposed expansion of the Green Line light rail system.

The proposal will be brought before the full City Council for a vote at their next meeting.
