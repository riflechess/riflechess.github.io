#### Meeting Info

* **Meeting Type:** Transportation Committee Meeting
* **Date/Time:** Thursday, March 21st, 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM
* **Location:** City Hall Council Chambers
* **Purpose:** To discuss and vote on transportation-related proposals for the city of Saint Paul.

#### Summary

The meeting began with a presentation from the city's Public Works department regarding proposed improvements to Summit Avenue. The department is recommending the installation of a new traffic signal at the intersection of Summit and Selby, which would help reduce congestion in the area. The proposal also includes improved pedestrian infrastructure, including wider sidewalks and additional lighting.

There was some discussion among committee members regarding the potential impact on local businesses. Some members expressed concerns that the increased traffic signal would make it more difficult for drivers to navigate the area, potentially deterring visitors from parking in nearby lots and shopping at local stores. However, others argued that improved pedestrian infrastructure would actually attract more customers to the area.

The committee voted 6-2 in favor of moving forward with the proposal, with Councilors Maria Nacre and Thomas voting against due to concerns about traffic congestion.

Additionally, the committee discussed a proposal to establish a new bike-sharing program in Saint Paul. The city is considering partnering with a local non-profit to provide affordable access to bikes for residents and visitors alike. Some members expressed enthusiasm for the idea, citing its potential benefits for public health and sustainability. Others raised concerns about the costs associated with implementing such a program.

No final vote was taken on the bike-sharing proposal, but it is expected to be brought before the full city council in the coming weeks.

The meeting concluded with no further action items or proposals on the table.
