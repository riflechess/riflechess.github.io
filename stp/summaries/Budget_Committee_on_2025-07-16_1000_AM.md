#### Summary

Dr. Susan Bauer presented data on population trends in Saint Paul using 2020 census data. Key points from the presentation include:

* Saint Paul experienced high growth rates between 2010 and 2020, with a 9% increase in population.
* However, since 2020, the growth rate has leveled off, and the city is now experiencing dissipated growth out towards suburban areas.
* The state of Minnesota as a whole is also seeing lower levels of growth due to aging populations and fewer births.
* Dr. Bauer noted that rapid growth in Saint Paul last decade was part of a national trend, but dissipated growth has begun, with people moving out towards suburban areas.

The presentation also covered the impact of population aging on public budgets and services, including:

* The baby boomers have been reaching retirement age, leading to labor force shortages and increased demands for healthcare and social services.
* Saint Paul is a relatively young city compared to the U.S., but will still experience impacts from aging populations outside of the city.

Council Members asked questions about the data, including:

* Council President Aker asked how Minnesota compares to other states in terms of population growth and migration patterns.
* Council Member Bowie asked if Dr. Bauer could speak to changes in life expectancy and socioeconomic factors contributing to aging populations.
* Council Member Jost asked about the history of detailed race groups in census data.

Dr. Brower (Bauer) provided additional information on poverty rates, transportation, and housing units in Saint Paul, including:

* About 14% of Saint Paul residents live in poverty, with higher rates among Hispanic or Latino, black or African American, and some Southeast Asian populations.
* The number of residents working from home has increased since the pandemic, with about 20% currently working remotely.

The meeting concluded with appreciation for Dr. Brower's presentation and expertise.
