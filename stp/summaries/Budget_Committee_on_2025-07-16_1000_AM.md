#### Summary
The Budget Committee meeting on July 16, 2025, featured a presentation by Dr. Susan Bauer, the Minnesota state demographer, on population trends in St. Paul using 2020 census data. The committee discussed the impact of aging baby boomers on public budgets and labor force growth.

Dr. Bauer presented data showing that St. Paul's population grew rapidly between 2010 and 2020, but has since leveled off due to demographic changes such as an aging population and lower birth rates. She noted that Minnesota's population is older than the national average, with more people aged 65+ than school-aged children. This shift will impact public budgets and labor force growth.

The committee also discussed diversity in St. Paul, with Dr. Bauer presenting data showing a significant increase in racial and ethnic diversity, particularly among Asian and African American populations. She noted that 49.4% of St. Paul residents belong to a BIPOC group, although this number is likely higher due to non-response bias.

In response to questions from council members, Dr. Bauer explained the concept of "foreign-born" in data collection and provided context on why it is still used despite its limitations. She also discussed the challenges of collecting detailed race data and acknowledged that these numbers are not as precise as individuals might like.

The committee touched on poverty rates in St. Paul, with Dr. Bauer noting that about 14% of residents live in poverty. She emphasized the importance of considering cost-of-living calculators when evaluating poverty levels and highlighted the need to almost double the poverty population to meet basic needs.

Council members expressed appreciation for Dr. Bauer's presentation and acknowledged the complexity of demographic trends in St. Paul. The meeting concluded with gratitude for Dr. Brower's expertise and a commitment from council staff to follow up on questions and provide additional data.
