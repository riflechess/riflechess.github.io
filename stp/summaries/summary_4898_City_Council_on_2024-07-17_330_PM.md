#### Summary
The city council meeting was filled with various agenda items, including a public hearing on the expansion of the downtown improvement district. The meeting began with a discussion on amendments to the overlay district on Grand Avenue, which aimed to streamline development and alleviate restrictions. However, this item was laid over until August 7th for further consideration.

The main focus of the meeting shifted to the public hearing on the comprehensive downtown improvement special service district (DID), where several community members spoke in opposition and support of the expansion. Opponents argued that it would lead to increased enforcement and prosecution of individuals based on their appearance, while supporters emphasized its benefits in creating a safer and cleaner environment.

The council also approved resolutions related to sound level variances for various events, including the Rondo Block Party and Water Lantern Festival. Additionally, they authorized the police department to accept additional funds for an amended award from the Minnesota Department of Public Safety's Office of Traffic Safety.

In other matters, the city council voted on a resolution amending the finance agreement for the fire department, which included reimbursement for equipment for the hazardous materials team. They also approved a resolution authorizing the city to enter into a purchase agreement for 60 West Sycamore to house public works solid waste and recycling services.

The legislative hearing consent agenda items 20 through 45 were also approved, with several community members speaking on various issues, including appeals related to vacant buildings and fence variances. The council adopted resolutions granting or denying these appeals.
