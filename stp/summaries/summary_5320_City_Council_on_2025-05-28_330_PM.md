#### Summary

The meeting began with a brief discussion on the consent agenda items 1 through 14. Mr. Provo made a motion to consider item 15, which was related to imposing a $1,000 matrix penalty and revised license conditions on MFK Auto.

Ms. Garda presented a detailed report on the history of the license violations and the proposed amendments to the license conditions. She explained that the current license conditions were outdated and needed to be updated to address the nuisance behavior complained about by neighbors.

Mokia, the licensee, spoke on behalf of MFK Auto, admitting some of the facts found by DSI inspectors but questioning others. He expressed concern about being treated as a single business when there are two separate dealerships operating at the same location.

Council President Nacre noted that the committee had discussed whether to send the matter to an administrative law judge for a hearing or to proceed with imposing the penalty. Ultimately, it was decided to refer the matter to an ALJ for a hearing.

The next item on the agenda was the presentation of the St. Paul Capital Improvement Budget Process Assessment Report conducted by Wilder Research. Dr. Heather Britt presented the findings and recommendations from the audit committee's third audit. The report highlighted areas for improvement in the CIB process, including transparency, equity, and accessibility. Key recommendations included clarifying roles and responsibilities across the process, documenting the current process, and implementing a pre-application phase.

Council members discussed the report and its recommendations, with some expressing enthusiasm for the findings and others noting that implementation of changes would take time.

The meeting concluded with the adoption of several resolutions, including approval of sound level variances for the Grand Avenue Business Association's events and amendments to the 2025 spending and budget in the Department of Public Works.
