The City Council held a Truth in Taxation public hearing on November 25, 2025, where they discussed the proposed 2026 budget. The budget includes a $232.5 million property tax levy increase, which is an 5.3% increase over the 2025 levy.

Many citizens spoke about their concerns regarding high property taxes and how it's affecting them financially. Some of the speakers also mentioned that they're considering leaving St. Paul due to the increasing property taxes.

The city's response to recent ICE raids was a major topic of discussion, with many speakers expressing outrage and disappointment at the actions of the St. Paul Police Department. The police department's use of pepper spray and tear gas on peaceful protesters sparked controversy, with some calling for an audit of the police department's spending.

Some citizens also spoke about the lack of transparency in budgeting and how it affects their ability to provide input on city decisions.

The City Council listened to the public comments and took note of the concerns raised. They assured the audience that they will consider all the feedback provided during the meeting when making decisions regarding the 2026 budget.

* Jeffrey Paquette, who recounted his experience of being pepper sprayed by police during an ICE raid

* Ari Dolliger, who asked questions about the city's budget allocation to federal law enforcement and local operations

* Tabith Mitchell, who suggested decertifying eight tax income and finance districts to reduce property taxes
