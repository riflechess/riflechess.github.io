#### Summary

The City Council met for a Truth in Taxation hearing to discuss the proposed 2026 budget and property tax levy. Community members expressed concerns about rising property taxes, affordable housing, public safety, and the role of the St. Paul Police Department in federal immigration enforcement.

Several speakers criticized the proposed budget, saying it did not prioritize frontline workers, libraries, and parks. Others called for increased funding for programs that support vulnerable populations, such as returning citizens and unhoused individuals.

The meeting also focused on the confrontation between SPPD and ICE agents earlier in the day, which many community members felt was a disturbing display of police brutality. Several speakers called for an audit of SPD spending and demanded accountability from the city council and mayor.

Some speakers suggested that the city should bill the federal government for the costs associated with responding to the ICE raid. Others questioned why the city is increasing funding for the police department when there are more pressing needs in the community.

Council members acknowledged the concerns raised by community members and promised to consider their suggestions as they finalize the budget. The meeting was adjourned after several hours of public testimony, but not before the council president vowed to take into account the feedback received that evening.

Key decisions made or discussed during the meeting include:

* Proposed 2026 budget: $886 million

	+ Debt service levy: $26 million
	+ Public library agency: $23 million
	+ Port Authority: $2.9 million
* Controversy surrounding the role of SPPD in federal immigration enforcement and the response to the ICE raid earlier in the day

* Will Thompson, who shared his concerns about the impact of tax increases on his 85-year-old home
* Jeffrey Paquette, who described being pepper-sprayed by SPPD during the ICE raid
* Isaac Milkey, who criticized the city's commitment to equity while paying poverty wages to frontline workers
* Carl Michaud, who suggested decertifying certain tax income and finance districts to reduce property taxes
