#### Summary
The meeting began with a presentation by Chief Budget Officer Kamud Verma on the proposed 2026 budget. The total operating budget is $886 million, with a general fund budget of $405 million (3.9% increase over 2025). Property tax levy is expected to increase by 5.3%. Council members emphasized that they had been listening to community feedback and would be proposing amendments to the mayor's proposal.

The public hearing portion of the meeting saw numerous speakers express concerns about property tax increases, funding for frontline workers, libraries, and parks. Many speakers criticized the city's handling of the recent ICE raid on Rose Street and called for greater accountability from the St. Paul Police Department.

Several speakers advocated for reducing the police department's budget and increasing funding for other essential services. Some suggested decertifying eight tax income and finance districts to save around $1 million, while others proposed focusing on fixing existing parks rather than building new ones.

The meeting concluded with Council President Noecker thanking attendees for their participation and acknowledging that it had been a tough moment in the community. The council will take into account the feedback received during the public hearing when considering the 2026 budget and property tax levy increase.
