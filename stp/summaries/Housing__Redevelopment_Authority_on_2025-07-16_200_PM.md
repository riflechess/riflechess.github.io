#### Summary

The Housing Redevelopment Authority (HRA) met to discuss budget-to-actual reports and CDBG grants. Director Green presented the budget-to-actual report, explaining that it is an accounting report showing actual versus budgeted expenses. The HRA's primary revenue for the Loan Enterprise Fund comes from state grants, but these grants are not guaranteed and may require additional funding.

Commissioner Naker expressed concern about the lack of direct line items for specific programs in the report, suggesting that a more program-based budgeting approach would be beneficial. Director Newton explained that the report is an accounting tool, not a programmatic one, and that they need to have discussions on how to make it actionable for decision-making.

The HRA also discussed CDBG grants, with Director Green presenting updates on federal funding changes. The administration's budget request proposed a 51% cut to HUD funding, but the House Transportation Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Committee released a preview of their spending bill that fully funded CDBG and ESG.

Bethel provided an update on HUD grants, including CDBG, Home Partnership Program, and Emergency Solutions Grant. She explained the impact of federal budget delays on grant funding and discussed potential changes to HUD's rules and regulations.

The meeting also addressed concerns about district council funding. Zoe Borgere, District Council Coordinator in PED, presented information on indirect cost rates for district councils and the challenges they face in reimbursing non-programmatic expenses. Commissioner Neaker suggested that the city consider replacing CDBG with a different source of funding to make it easier to manage.

Overall, the meeting focused on discussing budget-to-actual reports, CDBG grants, and district council funding concerns. The HRA is working towards establishing a strong budget-to-actual review process and exploring ways to address the challenges faced by district councils in managing their funds.
