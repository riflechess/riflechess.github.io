#### Summary
The Housing Redevelopment Authority meeting on 2025-06-18 focused on updates from the Familiar Faces program and consideration of funding for a new initiative called Familiar Families. The program aims to provide intensive care management services to individuals experiencing homelessness.

Chris Michaels presented an update on the Familiar Faces program, which has seen initial success with over 250 touches of outreach and housing placements for 20 individuals. The team is working towards building out the intensive care management team, including life coaches and behavioral health practitioners.

Commissioner Probosky highlighted the importance of investment from Ramsey County into these efforts, citing the city's need to play an active role in addressing homelessness while emphasizing the county's responsibility for funding human services.

The meeting also discussed the distinction between Familiar Faces and Familiar Families. Deputy Mayor Tinchner explained that Familiar Faces is a program focused on individuals experiencing homelessness, while Familiar Families aims to support families in need of housing and other services.

Commissioner Yang asked about long-term plans for funding both programs, with Deputy Mayor Tinchner responding that the city's approach will focus on re-envisioning community-first public safety structures to prioritize effective outcomes and sustainable resources. This approach seeks to address the high costs associated with emergency services by investing in prevention and intervention strategies.

The meeting concluded with a discussion of the importance of accountability and outcomes in the work done through Heading Home Ramsey, with Deputy Mayor Tinchner promising follow-up on specific metrics and data related to program effectiveness. Commissioner Bravatsky also highlighted the city's investment in a new family shelter space at Bandana Square, expressing enthusiasm for its potential to provide welcoming services to families in need.

The next steps for both programs will involve Heading Home Ramsey's governing board reviewing proposals and determining how to proceed with funding and programming for Familiar Families. Commissioner Naker emphasized the importance of understanding community feedback and suggestions on how to move forward with these initiatives, particularly as they relate to budgetary conversations and future investment opportunities.
