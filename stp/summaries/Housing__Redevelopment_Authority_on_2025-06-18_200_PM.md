#### Summary
The Housing and Redevelopment Authority met on June 18, 2025, to discuss various topics related to housing and redevelopment. The meeting started with the approval of two resolutions regarding parking enterprise revenue refunding bonds.

Chris Michaels from the Office of Neighborhood Safety presented an update on the Familiar Faces program, which aims to provide intensive care management services to individuals experiencing homelessness. The program has had initial success, with 20 individuals facilitated into housing and 8 more scheduled for placement by the end of the month. However, the team faces challenges in accessing resources, particularly from Ramsey County.

The meeting also discussed the Familiar Families program, which is a pilot initiative aimed at providing similar services to families experiencing homelessness. Deputy Mayor Jamie Tencher explained that the program was designed based on the successes of the Familiar Faces program and has received $500,000 from the Housing Trust Fund, matched by the St. Paul and Minnesota Foundation.

Commissioners expressed concerns about the long-term funding plan for both programs and asked for more information on the structure and goals of the Familiar Families program. They also discussed potential partnerships with Ramsey County and explored ways to address accountability in service delivery.

The meeting concluded with discussions about facilities for families, including a new shelter space at Bandana Square, and the direction of the Heading Home Ramsey governing board.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the city's efforts to address homelessness through various initiatives and emphasized the importance of collaboration and partnership between different stakeholders.
