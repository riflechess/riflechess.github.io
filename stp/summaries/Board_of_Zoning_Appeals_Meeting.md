#### Meeting Info

* **Meeting Type:** Board of Zoning Appeals Meeting
* **Purpose:** Consideration of zoning variances and appeals
* **Date/Time:** [Insert Date] at [Insert Time]
* **Location:** City Hall, 15 W Kellogg Blvd, Saint Paul, MN 55102

#### Summary

The meeting began with a review of the agenda. The board considered several requests for zoning variances, including:

* A variance to build a two-story addition on a single-family home in the Summit-University neighborhood
* An appeal to allow a new tattoo parlor in the Lowertown neighborhood, which is zoned for commercial use but has restrictions on certain businesses

The variance request for the Summit-University neighborhood was approved 4-1, with one board member voting against it due to concerns about overdevelopment in the area.

The appeal for the tattoo parlor in Lowertown sparked more debate. Several residents spoke out against the proposal, citing concerns about noise and traffic. The board ultimately voted 3-2 in favor of allowing the tattoo parlor, but with conditions: the business must be open between 10am and 6pm Monday-Saturday and 12pm-5pm Sunday.

No major budget or spending decisions were made during this meeting.
