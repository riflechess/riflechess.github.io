#### Summary
The meeting began with a review of the agenda, which included several zoning appeal cases. The first case involved a property owner seeking a variance to build a two-story addition on their single-family home in the Summit-University neighborhood. After hearing testimony from the applicant and nearby residents, the board voted 4-1 in favor of approving the variance.

The second case involved a dispute between a business owner and the city's zoning administrator over a signage ordinance. The business owner argued that the current regulations were too restrictive and would harm their ability to attract customers. The zoning administrator countered that the regulations were necessary to maintain the aesthetic appeal of the neighborhood. In the end, the board voted 3-2 against granting an exemption to the business.

Other topics discussed included:

* A proposed text amendment to the city's zoning code regarding accessory dwelling units (ADUs)
* A request from a property owner for a zoning variance to operate a home-based business
* An update on the city's efforts to implement more sustainable and energy-efficient building practices

No other significant action was taken or contentious issues arose. The next Board of Zoning Appeals meeting is scheduled for [Insert date].
