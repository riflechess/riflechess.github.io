#### Meeting Info
* **Type:** Board of Zoning Appeals Meeting
* **Purpose:** Review zoning variances, appeals, and other related matters
* **Date/Time:** March 10, 2023, at 5:00 PM

#### Summary

The Board of Zoning Appeals meeting covered several applications for zoning variances. The key decisions made were:

* Approved a variance for a new single-family home in the Highland Park neighborhood, allowing for a smaller lot size than usual.
* Denied an appeal from a property owner in the East Side neighborhood, who sought to increase their building's height beyond allowed limits.
* Tabled discussion on a proposed variance for a commercial development in the Lowertown area, pending additional information.

One point of contention arose during the discussion of the Lowertown project. One board member expressed concerns about the potential impact on nearby residents and businesses. Another member argued that the project would bring much-needed economic growth to the area. The board ultimately decided to table the decision until more information is available.

No major complaints or public safety issues were raised during the meeting.
