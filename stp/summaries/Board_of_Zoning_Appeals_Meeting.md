#### Summary

The meeting began with a review of the agenda, which included several appeals related to zoning variances. The first appeal was for a property on University Avenue, where the owner is seeking a variance to build a new three-story building despite exceeding the maximum height limit.

After hearing from both the applicant and several neighbors who spoke in opposition, the board voted 4-1 to deny the request. The dissenting vote came from member Sarah Johnson, who argued that the city's zoning regulations should be flexible enough to accommodate innovative development. However, her colleagues countered that granting a variance would set a precedent for other developers to ignore the rules.

The next appeal on the agenda was related to a property in the Summit-University neighborhood, where the owner is seeking to convert a single-family home into a multi-unit dwelling. After some discussion, the board voted unanimously (5-0) to approve the request, finding that it met all necessary zoning requirements.

In other business, the board discussed a proposal from the city's planning department to create a new overlay district for the East Bank neighborhood. The proposal aims to encourage more mixed-use development and pedestrian-friendly design in the area. While some members expressed concerns about potential density and parking issues, others praised the initiative as a step towards revitalizing the neighborhood.

There was no public comment period during this meeting.
