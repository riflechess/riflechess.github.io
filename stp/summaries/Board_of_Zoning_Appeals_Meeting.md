* **Context:** The meeting is focused on two variance requests: one for 550 Brunson Street and another for 1070 Jackson Street.

#### Summary

The Board of Zoning Appeals Meeting reviewed two variance requests. The first request, from 550 Brunson Street, was approved with a unanimous vote (6-0). The applicant proposed constructing a four-unit townhouse-style multiple-family dwelling on the vacant property, which aligns with the intent and purpose of the H2 zoning district.

The second request, from 1070 Jackson Street, involved establishing a supportive housing facility for up to 16 residents. Staff recommended denying the requested variance due to concerns about creating an institutional feel in the neighborhood. However, Board Members Martinson, Benner, Clarkson, and Miller argued that adding a licensure for food delivery would create state oversight instead of allowing unregulated activities.

Board Member Clarkson proposed moving to overturn the staff recommendation, citing that the situation is not changing and there's more oversight with the licensure. The motion was seconded by Board Member Martinson. After some discussion, the roll call vote resulted in 4-1 approval of the variance request, with Board Member Porter voting against it.

The decision is final unless appealed to the city council within 10 days.
