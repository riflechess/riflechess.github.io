#### Summary

The meeting began with a review of agenda items. The first item considered was a request for a zoning variance from a property owner on Rice Street. The applicant sought to build a three-story commercial building despite the existing zoning restriction allowing only two stories.

After discussion among board members, it was decided that the request would be tabled until more information could be provided about the proposal's impact on neighboring properties. Several neighbors expressed concerns about potential traffic and parking issues.

The second item considered was a request to rezone a property on University Avenue from residential to commercial use. The applicant argued that the change would align with the area's existing commercial development, but nearby residents were concerned about increased noise and disruption.

A vote was held, and the rezoning request passed 4-1, with one board member dissenting due to concerns about over-commercialization of the neighborhood.

The meeting concluded with a review of future agenda items and a reminder that public input is encouraged for upcoming zoning cases.
