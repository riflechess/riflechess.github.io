#### Summary

The meeting began with the approval of resolutions for 1070 Jackson Street and 770 University Avenue West. The Board then reviewed two variance requests: one from XL Energy Siting and Land Rights Group to relocate and increase the height of a cellular antenna, and another from Horowitz Health to establish a supportive housing facility.

The first request was approved unanimously after staff presented findings that supported the variance, citing practical difficulties in complying with the zoning code due to the property's unique characteristics. The applicant explained the need for the taller tower to ensure adequate coverage for their private network.

The second request was more contentious, with several neighbors and community members speaking out against it. They expressed concerns about increased traffic, noise, and parking congestion, as well as the potential impact on the neighborhood's character. However, Horowitz Health representatives presented evidence that their proposed supportive housing facility would provide essential services to residents, including 24-hour care, food, and peer support.

After hearing public comments, the Board laid over the decision for further consideration at the next meeting. The motion to lay over was approved with a vote of 4-0. This decision allows for additional time to review the matter and potentially gather more information before making a final decision.

It's worth noting that the Board also discussed the need for potential code amendments to better align with state licensure categories, which may impact future variance requests like this one. The applicants are facing a tight deadline to comply with new regulations, which has sparked concerns about their ability to continue operating without significant changes to their business model.
