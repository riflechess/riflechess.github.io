#### Summary
The Board of Zoning Appeals meeting was attended by members of the community, city officials, and the board. The main topics discussed were:

* Appeal 1: A property owner appealed a denied variance request for a proposed addition to their home in the Summit Hill neighborhood. After discussion, the board voted 4-1 in favor of granting the variance, with one member opposing due to concerns about the project's impact on neighboring properties.
* Appeal 2: Another property owner appealed a zoning decision regarding a commercial development in the Lowertown area. The board voted unanimously (5-0) to uphold the original decision, citing concerns about potential traffic and parking issues.

Notable discussion points included:

* A resident expressed concern about the lack of community engagement in the planning process for a proposed development in the Dayton's Bluff neighborhood.
* Another attendee questioned the feasibility of implementing affordable housing requirements in new developments. The city officials present explained that such requirements are being explored, but more research and data collection are needed before any policy changes can be implemented.

The meeting was generally civil, with most attendees respectful of each other's opinions and perspectives. However, there were some tense moments when the board members discussed the first appeal, particularly regarding the property owner's request for a variance.
