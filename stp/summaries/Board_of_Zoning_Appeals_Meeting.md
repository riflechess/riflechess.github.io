#### Summary
The meeting began with a discussion on the proposed variance request for a property located at 123 Main St. The applicant is seeking a variance to build a two-story addition to their existing single-family home, which would exceed the city's zoning regulations.

The board heard from the applicant and several neighbors who expressed concerns about the potential impact on traffic and parking in the area. After discussion, the board voted 3-2 in favor of granting the variance with certain conditions, including a requirement for additional parking spaces.

A second item on the agenda was an appeal related to a zoning decision made by the city's planning department. The property owner is challenging the denial of their request for a special use permit to operate a home-based business. The board heard from both parties and voted 4-0 to uphold the planning department's decision.

The meeting concluded with a brief discussion on the process for appealing zoning decisions, which will be added to the city's website for public reference.
