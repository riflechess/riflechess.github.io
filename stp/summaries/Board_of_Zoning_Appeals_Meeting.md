#### Summary
The Board of Zoning Appeals meeting covered several appeal cases, including a request for a variance to build a multi-unit residential building in the Highland Park neighborhood. The applicant argued that the building would be more suitable for the area due to its proximity to public transportation.

After hearing from the applicant and neighbors, the board voted 4-1 in favor of granting the variance, with one member dissenting due to concerns about increased density in the area.

The board also discussed a zoning ordinance amendment regarding signage regulations. The proposed change would allow for more flexible sign placement in commercial areas, but limit the size and type of signs allowed.

A resident expressed concern about the potential impact on local businesses, suggesting that it could lead to cluttered streetscapes. However, proponents argued that it would boost local businesses by allowing them to promote themselves more effectively.

The board voted 3-2 in favor of approving the ordinance amendment, with two members opposing due to concerns about aesthetics and visual clutter. The next step will be for the proposal to go before city council for final approval.
