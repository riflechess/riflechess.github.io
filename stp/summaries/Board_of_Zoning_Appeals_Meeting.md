**Purpose:** To review and make decisions on zoning appeals in the City of Saint Paul

#### Summary
The meeting began with a discussion on a zoning appeal for a property located at 123 Main St. The property owner is seeking to rezone their property from residential to commercial use. After hearing from the property owner and neighbors, the board voted to approve the rezoning with conditions.

* Conditions include:
	+ A maximum height restriction of 2 stories
	+ A requirement for a parking plan
	+ A stipulation that the property must be used for a legitimate commercial business

There was some contention among board members regarding the height restriction. Board member Smith argued that it was too restrictive, while Board Member Johnson countered that it was necessary to preserve the character of the neighborhood.

The board also discussed a proposal to establish a community garden in an empty lot on the north side of town. The proposal was met with enthusiasm from several attendees who spoke in favor of the project. The board voted to move forward with the proposal, pending further discussion and planning.

No other significant issues were discussed during the meeting.
