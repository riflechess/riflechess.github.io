#### Summary

The meeting focused on reviewing requests for variances at two properties: 2200 Ford Parkway and 0 Green Avenue. At 2200 Ford Parkway, the board approved variance requests 5-13 contingent on the site plan as submitted on November 18th, 2024. The approvals are attached to the site plan and do not apply to any amended or future plans.

At 0 Green Avenue, the board sustained staff recommendations for variances 3-6, contingent on the current site plan as submitted on November 18th, 2024. These requests were previously denied at a previous meeting but were approved this time around.

The chair noted that if the city council overturns the decision from last week's meeting, the project as submitted would be dead due to the denied variance requests. However, the board is approving the design for a building that cannot be built as per the current zoning laws.

No contentious issues or disputes were mentioned during the meeting, and all votes were unanimous except for Martinson who abstained on one of the motions. The next meeting is scheduled for February 3rd to review four more cases.
