#### Summary

The meeting focused on a variance request for 981 University Avenue West, where the applicant is proposing to demolish an existing building and construct a commercial building. The proposed development would have a floor area ratio of 0.39, which requires a variance of 0.11 from the required 0.5 FAR.

Staff presented findings that supported the proposal, citing practical difficulties in compliance with the zoning code due to the property's proximity to the light rail station and the alley along the north side. The proposed commercial building would frame University Avenue West and remove a curb cut from the avenue, improving urban design and safety.

The applicant, Remy, spoke on behalf of Arola Architecture Studio, explaining that they are seeking a minimal approval due to the proximity to the light rail station. They also discussed the need for surface parking in the back of the building and mentioned that they have reduced the number of packing requirements to accommodate the space.

Board members asked questions about the design of the building and its relation to the surrounding area. The architect, Kelly, explained that a two-story structure was not considered due to land constraints and the difficulty in venting dryers.

After closing public comments, the board voted unanimously (5-0) to approve the variance request based on staff's findings one through six. The decision is final unless appealed to the City Council within 10 days.

Note: The meeting transcript mentions a contentious issue with sober homes switching to supportive housing uses, but this topic was not discussed in detail during the meeting.
