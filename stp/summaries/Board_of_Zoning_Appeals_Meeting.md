#### Summary

The Board of Zoning Appeals meeting was held on March 22, 2023. The following items were discussed:

* Three zoning variance applications were considered:
	+ Application #1: A request to allow a second-story addition on a residential property in the Summit-University neighborhood.
	+ Application #2: A proposal for a new office building in the downtown area with increased height and density.
	+ Application #3: A request to allow a home-based business in a single-family zoned district.
* The board voted to approve all three applications, but not without some discussion on the second application. Commissioner Johnson expressed concerns about the impact on parking and pedestrian traffic, while Commissioner Thompson argued that the proposed building would bring much-needed density to the area.

No votes were unanimous on the third application, as Commissioner Lee voted against it due to concerns about potential noise disturbances from the home-based business.

Other notable discussion points included:

* A review of recent zoning enforcement actions in the city.
* Discussion on potential updates to the city's zoning ordinance.
