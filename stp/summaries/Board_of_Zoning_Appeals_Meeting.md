#### Summary
The meeting begins with introductions and explanations of the purpose and process. The Board reviews and discusses various variance requests for supportive housing facilities in St. Paul.

1. **Variancy Request 1223 Van Buren Avenue**: The applicant is requesting a variance for a second-story dormer addition onto an existing single-family dwelling. David Eide from the Department of Safety and Inspections explains that the proposed addition meets all six findings, and staff recommends approval subject to specific conditions.

2. **Old Business: Supportive Housing Variance Requests**: Josh Ladd discusses the requirements and legal framework for granting variances in supportive housing cases. He emphasizes the need for applicants to meet the six findings required by state law and the city's ordinance.

3. **Supportive Housing Facility at 889 Igleheart Avenue**: The applicant is requesting a variance for a facility with up to 11 residents, which is within 1,320 feet of another congregate living facility. Staff recommends denial based on findings three, four, and six.

4. **Supportive Housing Facility at 764 Lincoln Avenue**: This case involves a proposed supportive housing facility with eight residents, which would be licensed as an intensive residential treatment services program. The applicant explains the benefits of this model, including more stringent requirements for staff qualifications and services provided.

5. **Supportive Housing Facility at 709 University Avenue West**: The applicant is requesting a variance to convert office space on the second floor into 19 units of supportive housing for homeless youth. David Ives from the Department of Safety and Inspections explains that while the proposal meets some findings, it does not meet others due to the property's proximity to other supportive housing facilities.

6. **Variancy Request at 418 Sherburn Avenue**: This case involves a proposed supportive housing facility with 24 residents, which is within 513 feet of another congregate living facility. The applicant explains that the state's criteria for board and lodge licenses are different from the city's zoning regulations.

7. **Supportive Housing Facility at 437 Shirt Run Avenue**: Robert McLean opposes the variance request due to concerns about the impact on his neighborhood, which has a high crime rate and already struggles with drug dealing and violence.

The meeting concludes with the Board voting to deny several of the supportive housing variance requests, as they did not meet all the necessary findings or raised concerns about clustering and institutional environments in the neighborhoods.
