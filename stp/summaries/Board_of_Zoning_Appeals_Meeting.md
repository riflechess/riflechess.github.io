#### Summary
The meeting began with a presentation on two variance requests: one from Concordia University St. Paul to install new wall signs on their campus, and another from Ryan Companies (Block 2B) for a mixed-use development project at 2200 Ford Parkway. The Board of Zoning Appeals heard public comments and discussed the proposals.

The first request from Concordia University was approved with a vote of 8-0 after staff presented findings that supported the requested variances, citing practical difficulties in complying with the zoning regulations due to the large size of the campus and unique development challenges.

The second proposal, Block 2B (2200 Ford Parkway), saw controversy among Board members. Some members questioned whether the project met the density requirements outlined in the Highland Bridge Master Plan, while others argued that the project did not comply with transportation policies, including bike parking requirements. The applicant had submitted a supplement addressing these concerns.

In a contentious discussion, Chair Miller pointed out inconsistencies between the proposal and the comprehensive plan, citing issues such as FAR (floor area ratio) variances, building height, lot coverage, and pedestrian easements. Board member Martinson proposed denying the variance request for Block 2B due to its failure to meet density requirements.

The vote on Block 2B resulted in a denial of the variance requests with a roll-call vote of 6-2 (Benner and Porter dissenting). Chair Miller then moved to discuss Zero Cretan Avenue, which saw similar concerns about meeting density requirements.

In the end, both Block 2B (2200 Ford Parkway) and Zero Cretan Avenue received denied variance requests. The decisions are final unless appealed to the City Council within 10 days.
