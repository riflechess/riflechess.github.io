#### Summary
The meeting began with a brief discussion on the agenda for the evening. The first appeal was regarding a zoning variance request for a property at 123 Main St. The owner is seeking to add a second story to their residence, which would require a zoning variance due to local ordinances.

After hearing testimony from the property owner and city staff, the board voted 4-1 to grant the variance, citing the property's unique topography as a valid reason for the exception. One board member dissented, expressing concerns about setting a precedent for future appeals.

The next item on the agenda was an appeal regarding a proposed new development at 456 Cedar St. The developer is seeking to build a six-story apartment complex, which would require a zoning change from residential to commercial use. A lengthy discussion ensued between city staff and members of the public, with some expressing concerns about increased traffic and noise.

The board ultimately voted 3-2 to approve the zoning change, but not without controversy. One member argued that the development would be a boon for local businesses, while another expressed concern that it would "overdevelop" the area. The developer has agreed to work with city staff to address some of these concerns, including implementing traffic mitigation measures and providing community benefits.

In other business, the board also discussed and approved several minor zoning appeals related to property lines and setbacks. These decisions were largely uncontested and passed unanimously.

Overall, while there was some debate on key issues, the meeting remained civil and productive, with the board making thoughtful decisions on complex zoning matters.
