#### Summary
The Board of Zoning Appeals met to consider several appeals related to zoning variances. The main agenda items were:

* Appeal #1: Request for a variance to build a second-story addition on a single-family home in the Historic District.
	+ The applicant argued that the addition would not alter the exterior character of the building, but neighbors expressed concerns about increased density and potential impact on property values.
	+ After discussion, the board voted 4-1 to grant the variance, with one member opposing due to concerns about precedent-setting and over-development.
* Appeal #2: Request for a zoning change to allow for a new mixed-use development in the downtown area.
	+ The applicant presented plans for a four-story building with commercial space on the first floor and residential units above.
	+ Some board members expressed concerns about parking and density, while others praised the project's potential to revitalize the area.
	+ The board voted 3-2 to recommend approval of the zoning change, with one member opposed due to concerns about traffic congestion.

No significant public safety or quality of life issues were raised during the meeting.
