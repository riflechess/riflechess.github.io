#### Summary
The meeting began with a review of pending zoning appeals. The first item on the agenda was an appeal by Smith Construction to build a three-story apartment complex in the Highland neighborhood. The appellant argued that the current zoning laws were too restrictive and would prevent them from building affordable housing.

After hearing testimony from both sides, the board voted 4-2 to approve the variance, citing the need for more affordable housing options in the area. However, some members expressed concerns about overdevelopment in the neighborhood.

Other notable items on the agenda included:

* A request by a local business owner to install a parking lot expansion in the Summit-University neighborhood
* An appeal by a resident of the West End neighborhood to remove a non-conforming building that was built without proper permits

The board voted 5-0 to approve the parking lot expansion, but denied the appeal related to the non-conforming building.

The meeting concluded with no significant public comments or new business. The next Board of Zoning Appeals Meeting is scheduled for April 26, 2023, at 2:00 PM.
