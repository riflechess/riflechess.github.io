**Meeting Type:** Board of Zoning Appeals Meeting
**Date/Time:** Not specified in the provided text
**Purpose:** Review and decide upon requests for zoning code variances, administrative reviews, and requests to modify the home occupation requirements for handicapped individuals.
**Context:** The meeting appears to be focused on a single case involving a proposal to establish three short-term rental dwelling units at 213 4th Street East in downtown Saint Paul.

#### Summary
The board reviewed a request from the applicant, Jacks, to establish three short-term rental dwelling units in a five-story building at 213 4th Street East. The proposal involves variances for zoning code limits on short-term rentals and occupancy limits. Staff recommended approval of the requested variances based on findings that the proposal is in harmony with the general purposes and intent of the zoning code, aligns with the comprehensive plan, and addresses practical difficulties.

However, there was a notable moment of contention when Kyle Erickson abstained from voting, but his reason for doing so was not specified. The meeting transcript does not provide further details on why Erickson chose to abstain.

The board ultimately approved the requested variances with a vote of 7-0, although it's worth noting that Dayton and Porter both abstained from voting. Despite the lack of opposition, the proposal still raised concerns about the potential impact on the neighborhood and the city's regulations regarding short-term rentals.

It is also worth mentioning that there were three letters submitted in opposition to the request, but they did not raise any significant points that were not addressed by staff during their presentation. Overall, the meeting seemed to focus primarily on the technical aspects of the proposal, with little discussion on potential community impacts or concerns.
