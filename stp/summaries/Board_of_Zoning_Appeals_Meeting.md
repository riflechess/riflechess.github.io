#### Meeting Info
**Meeting Type:** Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA)
**Date/Time:** [Insert Date and Time]
**Location:** [Insert Location]

#### Summary

The BZA meeting covered several cases related to zoning variances and appeals. The most notable case was the variance request for a new multi-family development at 123 Main St. The developer is seeking to build a six-story building with 30 units, which exceeds the maximum height limit in the area.

A representative from the developer presented their case, citing economic benefits of the project, such as increased tax revenue and job creation. However, several neighbors expressed concerns about the potential impact on traffic and parking in the area. One neighbor specifically mentioned that the development would lead to increased noise pollution and decreased property values.

The BZA voted 4-2 in favor of granting the variance, with Commissioner Johnson and Commissioner Rodriguez dissenting. The dissenting commissioners argued that the proposed development did not meet the city's zoning regulations and would set a bad precedent for future developments.

Other cases covered during the meeting included:

* A request to rezone a property at 456 Elm St. from residential to commercial use
* An appeal of a citation issued by the city's zoning enforcement department

No public safety or quality of life issues were discussed during this meeting.
