#### Summary

The Board of Zoning Appeals meeting was focused on hearing appeals and making decisions on zoning variances. The following items were discussed:

* Variances requested for 321 5th St E: The applicant is seeking a variance to build an additional floor on the existing building, which would exceed the current zoning height limit.
* Variance request for 1230 Rice St: The applicant is requesting a variance to operate a home-based business in a residential area.

Decisions:

* The BZA approved the variance request for 321 5th St E with conditions that include reducing the additional floor's footprint by 20% and installing noise-reducing windows.
* The BZA denied the variance request for 1230 Rice St due to concerns about potential noise and disruption to nearby residents.

There was significant discussion regarding the 321 5th St E proposal, with some board members expressing concerns about the impact on neighboring businesses. However, after hearing from the applicant and neighbors, the majority of the board agreed that the conditions proposed would mitigate any negative effects.

No other notable decisions or contentious issues arose during this meeting.
