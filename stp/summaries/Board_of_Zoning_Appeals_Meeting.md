#### Summary
The Board of Zoning Appeals reviewed two variance requests. The first request was from Patrick McMahon for a detached garage at 280 Duke Street. The applicant requested variances for setback and square footage requirements. Staff recommended approval subject to conditions that the gazebo be demolished prior to issuance of the building permit, and the proposed garage be constructed with gutters and downspouts.

The second request was from Charles Colvin, representing St. Paul Public Schools, for an off-street surface parking facility at 1930 Como Avenue. The applicant requested variances for screening requirements along Loriant Street and from residential properties to the south. Staff recommended approval based on findings that the proposed variance aligns with the intent and purpose of the zoning code.

Both requests were approved by a unanimous vote (5-0) after discussion and without public opposition or comment.

Note: There was no significant contention or disagreement during either review, and both applicants were present to answer questions from the Board.
