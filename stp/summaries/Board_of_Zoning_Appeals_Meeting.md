#### Summary
The meeting focused on a variance request by Michael Tadros and his wife Danielle for their sober house at 770 University Avenue West. They are seeking to convert the building into supportive housing, which would allow them to provide services such as food and lodging to up to 10 residents.

The staff report recommended denying the variance due to concerns about the proximity of the proposed facility to another supportive housing facility across the street. The applicants argued that their facility is different from the one across the street, citing its focus on serving women of all ages, rather than just Indigenous youth between 18 and 24. They also highlighted the benefits of their sober house model, which provides a safe environment for residents to receive treatment and support services.

Board Members debated the issue, with some expressing concerns about the proximity of the facilities and others arguing that the applicants have presented sufficient evidence of practical difficulties in changing their business model. After discussion, Board Member Miller moved to overturn staff's decision and approve the variance request, which was seconded by Schweitzer and approved 5-1.

The meeting also touched on the topic of Sober Houses vs. Supportive Housing, with some Board Members expressing concerns about the sudden shift in policy at the state level that is forcing sober houses to convert to supportive housing. The applicants emphasized that they have no intention of changing their business model or providing additional services beyond food and lodging.

The meeting concluded with a discussion about the importance of involving District Councils in the decision-making process, as well as concerns about the timing of variance requests and the need for more education on the differences between Sober Houses and Supportive Housing.
