#### Summary
The meeting began with a review of the agenda, which included three zoning appeal cases. The first case involved a request for a variance to build a multi-family dwelling in a single-family zoned neighborhood. After hearing from both the applicant and an opposing neighbor, the board voted 3-1 to approve the variance. The dissenting member expressed concerns about over-development in the area.

The second case was a zoning appeal related to signage for a local business. The applicant requested permission to install larger signs on the property, citing increased visibility and foot traffic. However, one member of the board raised concerns about sign clutter and potential visual impacts on the surrounding neighborhood. After a brief discussion, the board voted 2-2, effectively tabling the decision.

The third case involved a request for a zoning amendment to allow for a community garden in a residential area. The applicant presented a detailed proposal, including plans for irrigation systems and waste management. The board expressed enthusiasm for the project and unanimously approved the zoning amendment.

Overall, the meeting focused on balancing development needs with concerns about neighborhood character and quality of life.
