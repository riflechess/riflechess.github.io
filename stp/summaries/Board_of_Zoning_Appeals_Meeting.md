#### Summary

The meeting primarily focused on two variance requests from the same applicant, Chad Unger. The first request was to convert a single-family dwelling into a religious institution in an H1 residential zoning district. The second request was to establish an 11-resident supportive housing facility.

For the first request, the Board approved the variance after considering staff's findings and public testimony. The application included converting the property from a single-family dwelling into a religious institution, which would allow for more space than required by code.

The second request involved establishing an 11-resident supportive housing facility. Chad Unger argued that his organization was not expanding its services but rather complying with new regulations requiring them to provide meals and staffing. He emphasized the importance of providing safe places for people recovering from addiction and stated that the proposed variance would not change the fundamental nature of their operation.

The Board ultimately denied the second request, citing findings three and four from staff's report: the practical difficulty standard was not met since the applicant could house up to six individuals at the property by right without meeting the required separation distance. The Board also considered other available locations for the facility that would meet the zoning requirements.

Board members acknowledged the difficulty of the situation but ultimately decided that the current rules must be followed, as any deviation based on financial reasons is not allowed under state law and the city's ordinance.
