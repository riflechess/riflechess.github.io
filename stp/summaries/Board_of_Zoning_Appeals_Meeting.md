#### Summary
The meeting began with a review of the agenda, which included several variance requests for new construction projects in various neighborhoods. The first item discussed was a request for a variance to allow a three-story building to be constructed on a previously zoned single-family residential lot in the Summit-University neighborhood.

A nearby resident spoke out against the proposal, expressing concerns about increased density and potential strain on local infrastructure. The applicant's representative countered by highlighting the benefits of mixed-use development and the project's alignment with city plans for sustainable growth.

The board voted 4-1 to approve the variance request, with one member dissenting due to concerns about traffic congestion in the area. Another request was also approved, but with conditions related to parking and building design.

A third item on the agenda involved an appeal of a zoning enforcement action against a property owner in the Frogtown neighborhood. The board ultimately dismissed the appeal after hearing testimony from both sides and considering additional evidence presented by city staff.

Overall, the meeting focused primarily on land-use issues and development proposals, with most decisions reaching consensus among the board members.
