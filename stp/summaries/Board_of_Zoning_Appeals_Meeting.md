#### Summary

The Board of Zoning Appeals meeting focused on three main items: a variance request for an in-ground swimming pool at 1530 Edgecombe Road and three applications at 905 Woodlawn Avenue. The first item was approved with a vote of 7-0.

For the swimming pool variance, David Eide presented the case, stating that the property owner proposes to install a non-obscuring fence along the eastern side of the pool, which is harmonious with the zoning code's general purpose and intent. Staff recommended approval, citing findings that the variance was in harmony with the zoning code, practical difficulties existed in complying with the provision, and the property owner had demonstrated unique circumstances.

The public hearing for this item saw no speakers in favor or opposition, and the Board voted 7-0 to approve the variance request.

For the Woodlawn Avenue applications, David Eide presented each case individually. The first unit (Unit E) requested a 0.39-foot variance due to an error in construction, which resulted in a shorter setback from the right-of-way than required. Staff recommended approval, citing findings that the variance was in harmony with the zoning code, practical difficulties existed in complying with the provision, and the property owner had demonstrated unique circumstances.

The public hearing for these items saw no speakers in favor or opposition, and the Board voted 7-0 to approve each of the three variance requests (Units E, F, and G).

There was no significant disagreement or arguing during the meeting.
