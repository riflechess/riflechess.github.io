#### Summary
The meeting began with the adoption of Resolution 24-1458, declaring October as Domestic Violence Awareness Month, and the introduction of the tobacco license revocation case against One Stop Market LLC. The council heard public comments from stakeholders and discussed the issue at length.

Next, the council held a public hearing on Ordinance 24-24, which would rezone the property at 629 Bush Avenue. However, no one spoke in opposition to the ordinance, and it was laid over for final adoption on October 9th.

The council then approved resolutions related to sound level variances for several businesses, including Wabasha Brewing Company and Richard Beck. They also adopted resolutions approving the request of District Energy St. Paul, Inc. to amend district cooling rates and heating rates for fiscal year 2025.

In a contentious discussion, the council debated whether to revoke the tobacco license held by One Stop Market LLC due to repeated violations of flavored tobacco regulations. After hearing arguments from both sides, the council decided to lay over the issue for one week to allow members to review additional information.

The meeting concluded with the adoption of several legislative hearing consent agenda items and a combined public hearing on the remainder of the agenda.
