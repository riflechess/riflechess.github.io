#### Summary

The meeting began with a motion to approve the balance of the consent agenda, which was adopted. Item 18 was a resolution celebrating the one-year anniversary of the Minnesota Toy Library in St. Paul. The library provides toys for children from birth to five years old and aims to reduce waste associated with playtime.

Council members shared their favorite childhood toys and praised the library's innovative approach. Council President Johnson commended the library's work and introduced its leaders, who explained how the toy library operates. The resolution was adopted unanimously.

Item 19 involved the final adoption of an ordinance approving the application for rezoning properties at Six 94 Minnehaha Avenue East from industrial to residential. Chair Johnson supported the motion, stating that it would create affordable housing and redevelop a vacant site.

The council also discussed zoning regulations for sober houses and supportive housing facilities. A public hearing was held on Item 21 regarding changes to Margaret Street between Arcade and East 7th Streets. The proposed change would convert a one-way street to two-way traffic, but there were no speakers in opposition.

Several items involved public hearings on resolutions related to parks and recreation, including using parkland dedication funds for the Linwood Park improvements project. Another resolution was adopted to accept grant funds for Hamsbury redevelopment at 680-695 Minnehaha Avenue East.

A contentious item was a public hearing on Item 24, which approved three sound variance requests from the University of St. Thomas for events in the stadium. An advocate from the neighborhood expressed concerns about noise levels and potential impacts on residents, but Councilor Provradsky supported the motion, stating that it would bring thousands of fans to the area.

A special tax assessment was discussed regarding property at 815 University Avenue West. The property owner, Greg Ryan, testified that he had been informed by a police officer that the city would cover the cleanup costs, leading to confusion and miscommunication about responsibilities. After discussion, the council decided to lay over the resolution for two weeks to gather more information.

The meeting concluded with tributes to Councilor Provradsky's service as an interim member, with praise from fellow councilors and the mayor. The last item on the agenda was a public hearing on remaining legislative items, which were closed after no further speakers were heard.
