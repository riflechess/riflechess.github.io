#### Summary

The meeting started with a roll call of council members, followed by the consent agenda, which was adopted without any opposition. The first reading of Ordinance 26-2 was discussed, which changes references in the legislative and administrative codes from "animal control" to "animal services." Director Angie Wiese presented a staff report on the ordinance, highlighting the need for the change due to outdated terminology.

The council also discussed Item 14, which is the first reading of Ordinance 26-2. There was some discussion about the animal service officers' uniforms and how they distinguish themselves from other uniformed agents in public.

Next, the council moved on to public hearings, starting with Item 16, which is the St. Anthony Rondo Arterial Mill and Overlay Project. The staff report explained that the project will cost $4.5 million and will improve pavement conditions, bicycle connectivity, and pedestrian safety along the corridor.

The council also discussed Item 17, which is the Wheelock Grotto Phase 2 Area Paving and Lighting and Mill and Overlay Project. However, due to a delay in mailing notices to property owners, the public hearing was continued until January 28th.

Item 18 was the resolution accepting grant funds for the Rondo Community Land Trust mixed-use redevelopment at 642 Selly Avenue. The council approved this item without any opposition.

The legislative hearing consent agenda items were also discussed, and after a brief presentation by Ms. Mormont, the public hearing was opened for comments from property owners. Mr. Richardson spoke about his concerns regarding the rain garden on his property, which he has been caring for since 2022. He expressed his desire to have the plantings be allowed to grow higher than 24 inches.

The council then moved on to discuss Item 31, which is a nuisance abatement order for 1079 Western Avenue North. The inspector's report showed that there were still pallets and tires present on the property despite previous deadlines. Vice President Kim made a motion to lay over this item for one week to January 21st.

The council also discussed suspending the rules to introduce an ordinance regarding the separation of police officers from immigration enforcement. Council Member Bowie introduced the motion, but it was met with opposition from some members who felt that the process had not been followed correctly. After a roll call vote, the motion failed to pass due to lack of support.

Finally, the meeting concluded with news from around the wards, including announcements about constitutional observer training and upcoming events celebrating Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.
