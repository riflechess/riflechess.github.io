#### Summary
The meeting covered several agenda items, including a resolution commemorating Indigenous Peoples Day and a historic co-management agreement between the city and Walk-On-Tipi Awenkapi. The council also discussed and approved an ordinance to address wage theft in St. Paul, which would allow city investigators to educate and enforce labor standards related to wages. Additionally, the council considered several public hearing items, including a request for sound level variance at Harriet Island and a matter related to rehabilitation or removal of structures at 887 Charles Avenue.

The city's proposed wage theft ordinance was presented by Beth Comers from HERO, who highlighted the prevalence of wage theft in St. Paul, particularly among low-wage workers. The council heard from community leaders and members of the Labor Standards Advisory Committee, who expressed support for the ordinance. After discussion, the ordinance was laid over to October 23rd for a second reading public hearing.

The council also considered several other agenda items, including resolutions related to sound level variance and property rehabilitation. In one case, the owner of a property at 887 Charles Avenue failed to provide sufficient evidence of funding for the proposed rehabilitation, leading to a recommendation from staff that the city refer the matter to legislative hearing on November 12th.
