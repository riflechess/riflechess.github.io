#### Summary
The workshop focused on introducing Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles for improving public safety and quality of life in Saint Paul's public spaces. Patty Lammers, a CPTED professional with the St. Paul Police Department, presented the basics of CPTED and its application in various settings.

Key points discussed include:

* **Natural Surveillance**: Placing physical features, activities, and people to maximize visibility, including:
	+ Proper lighting (cool white, directed downward)
	+ Redesigning areas that offer concealment
	+ Landscaping (trees, shrubs, bushes)
* **Access Control**: Directing people where you want them to be, accentuating entries, and providing direction for pedestrians:
	+ Entrances and exits
	+ Fencing and landscaping
	+ Gates and signage
* **Territorial Reinforcement**: Defining spaces, showing ownership, and defining entryways:
	+ Entry signs at all parks
	+ Defining transitions between public and private property
	+ Encouraging community ownership and personalization of park space
* **Traffic Calming**: Reducing the negative effects of motorized traffic on people, environment, and quality of life:
	+ Street closures (full or half)
	+ Barriers
	+ Diverters and medians
	+ Raised intersections
	+ Roundabouts

Lammers highlighted examples of successful CPTED projects in Saint Paul, including the Central Park lighting improvement project, which saw a significant increase in community activity and usage after new lighting was installed.

The presentation concluded with an invitation for attendees to reach out with questions or concerns via email (patricia.lammers@stpaul.gov) or phone (651-266-5455).
