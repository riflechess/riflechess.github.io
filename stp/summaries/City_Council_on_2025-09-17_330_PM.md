**Type:** Live and Recorded Public meeting of City Council for the City of Saint Paul

#### Summary
The city council meeting was a lengthy discussion on several rent stabilization determinations. The most notable part of the meeting was the debate and vote on the appeal of Jim Prattik's and Abby Hanson's clients, representing various tenants in different units at 942 Ashland Avenue.

Council Member Bowie proposed an amendment to grant the appeal but with a condition that limits the rent increase from 28.5% to 20%. The amendment also included a phased-in approach, with a 10% increase after the completion of the fire certificate of occupancy and another 10% six months later. This proposal was met with some opposition, particularly from Council Members Jost and Johnson, who expressed concerns about the administrability of this approach.

The motion to grant the appeal with the proposed amendment failed with three in favor and four opposed. However, the council then voted on a separate motion to grant the appeal without the conditions proposed by Bowie, which passed with four in favor and three opposed.

The remaining items on the agenda were also discussed and voted on, including several appeals related to rent stabilization determinations at 934 Ashland Avenue and 942 Ashland Avenue. The council approved granting all of these appeals.

Additionally, the council heard from city staff about a new initiative to improve the communication between landlords and tenants regarding maintenance and repairs. They also discussed an upcoming Housing Resource Fair hosted by SPART (St. Paul Area Association of Realtors) on September 25th.

The meeting concluded with a brief discussion of good news and announcements, including a Chromosome Mural and Art Festival happening this weekend in South St. Anthony Park and West Midway, and a Marriedale Festival coming up on September 27th at Marriedale Park.
