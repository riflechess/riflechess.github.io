#### Meeting Info
**Meeting Type:** City Council Meeting
**Date/Time:** 2025-09-17, 3:30 PM
**Purpose:** Discussion and voting on various appeals related to rent stabilization determinations in the city of Saint Paul.

#### Summary

The meeting focused on discussing and voting on several appeals related to rent stabilization determinations. The Council discussed a policy that allows landlords to request exemptions from the 3% annual rent increase, with some members arguing that the policy was not being applied consistently.

**Rent Stabilization Policy Discussion**

* The Council discussed a motion to deny an appeal for a rent stabilization determination at 934 Ashland Avenue, Unit 2.
* Council Member Bowie proposed a compromise, which would partially grant the appeal by decreasing the rent cap from 25% to 20%. This increase would be phased in over time, with a 10% increase after the inspection and another 10% increase six months later.
* The motion was put to a roll-call vote but failed with four opposed (Kim, Yang, Johnson, and Noecker) and three in favor (Jost, Kim, and Yang).

**Subsequent Votes**

* Item 28: RLH, RSA 25-13, appeal of Jim Prattek and Abby Hanson, attorneys for Housing Justice Center, representing tenant Kayla Simonson.
	+ Council Member Bowie moved to grant the appeal, which was adopted as amended with four in favor (Kim, Yang, Noecker, and Johnson) and three opposed (Jost, Bowie, and Coleman).
* Items 29-31: RLH, RSA 25-14, appeal of Jim Prattek and Abby Hanson, attorneys for Housing Justice Center, representing tenants Jessica Scar, Samuel Perkins, and Chloe Cable.
	+ Each item was voted on separately, with the resolution adopted as amended to grant the appeal in all cases.

**Consent Agenda**

* The Council approved items 32-51 on the Consent Agenda without discussion or opposition.
