#### Summary

The meeting began with a review of the agenda and introductions. The first order of business was the approval of the August minutes.

*   **Approved Minutes:** The LSAC approved the August minutes without any changes.
*   **Budget Discussion:** A discussion on the proposed budget for the next fiscal year took place, focusing on allocations for community programs and infrastructure improvements.

    The main topic of contention arose during the budget discussion when Councilor Lee suggested reducing funding for the city's youth recreation program by 10% to allocate more funds towards road maintenance. However, Councilors Maria and John strongly disagreed with this proposal, arguing that cutting funding for essential services would disproportionately affect low-income families.
*   **Public Safety:** A resident expressed concerns about recent break-ins in the area, prompting a discussion on public safety measures. The LSAC agreed to request additional police presence in the neighborhood.

    Councilor Lee emphasized the need for community engagement and education to prevent crime, while Councilor Maria suggested implementing a neighborhood watch program.
*   **Community Events:** The meeting concluded with an update on upcoming community events, including a street festival scheduled for October 1st.

The LSAC also voted on several resolutions:

*   **Resolution 001-2025:** Approved, allocating $10,000 to support the city's youth recreation program
*   **Resolution 002-2025:** Tabled, pending further review of the proposed budget adjustments

The meeting adjourned at 7:30 PM.
