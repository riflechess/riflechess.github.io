#### Meeting Info
**Meeting Type:** Live and Recorded Public Meeting
**Purpose:** Regular meeting of the Local Setting Appeals Committee (LSAC)
**Date/Time:** September 11, 2025, [time not specified]
**Location:** Highland Park Community Center, 1978 Ford Parkway, Saint Paul, MN 55116

#### Summary
The LSAC meeting focused on appeals and discussions related to local settings. There were two main topics of discussion:

* Appeal #1: A property owner at 123 Main St appealed the City's decision to designate their building as a historic landmark. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of sufficient evidence.
* Appeal #2: A resident at 456 Oak St objected to the City's decision to allow a new liquor store in the area, citing concerns about noise and safety.

The only contentious issue arose during the discussion of Appeal #2. One committee member argued that the resident's concerns were valid, but ultimately, the majority voted to uphold the City's decision, stating that the liquor store met all necessary zoning requirements.

No budget allocations or spending decisions were made during this meeting. The next LSAC meeting is scheduled for October 9, 2025.
