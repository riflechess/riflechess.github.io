#### Summary

The meeting began with a presentation from the Parks and Recreation Department on the financial picture of Como Zoo. Director Rodriguez and his team provided an overview of the zoo's budget, attendance numbers, and revenue sources. They discussed the importance of earned revenue sources, including food and beverage sales, facility rentals, and special events.

Council Member Yang asked about potential missed opportunities for revenue generation, particularly with regards to concession stands and kiosks being under-staffed during peak times. Director Rodriguez acknowledged the issue and stated that they are always looking for ways to improve revenue streams.

The meeting also touched on the topic of equity and fairness in regards to zoo attendance and funding. Council Member Johnson mentioned that St. Paul residents make up only 16% of zoo visitors, but bear 45% of the cost through taxes. She suggested exploring models where St. Paul residents receive free or discounted services.

Regarding the big cat exhibit project, Director Rodriguez explained that it was originally requested for $20 million, but due to state priorities and competing requests, it may not be funded this legislative session. Council Member Kim asked about the roadmap for the project, including a timeline and potential fundraising efforts by Como Friends.

The meeting concluded with a discussion on the accreditation process and its implications for philanthropy and revenue generation. Council Member Yang suggested promoting voluntary donations as a way to encourage more giving from both St. Paul residents and non-residents.

Overall, the meeting highlighted several key issues, including:

* The importance of earned revenue sources and exploring new ways to generate revenue
* Equity and fairness concerns regarding zoo attendance and funding
* The potential for the big cat exhibit project to be delayed or not funded
* The implications of accreditation on philanthropy and revenue generation

Several follow-up items were agreed upon, including providing data on concession amenities seasonality, fee discounts for St. Paul residents, and a deeper dive into financials (known as "nerd work").
