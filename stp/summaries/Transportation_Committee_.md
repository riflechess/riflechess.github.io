#### Summary
The Transportation Committee met to discuss several proposals for new transportation projects and review the current budget. Key points include:

* **Budget Allocation:** The committee approved a $1 million allocation for a new bike-sharing program in low-income neighborhoods.
* **Light Rail Expansion:** A proposal to extend the light rail line to the East Side of Saint Paul was discussed, but no decision was made due to concerns about cost and funding.
* **Public Safety:** Committee members expressed concerns about safety along the proposed route for the new bike lane on Rice Street, citing high rates of pedestrian accidents.

There was significant discussion and disagreement regarding the allocation of funds for a potential new highway project. Some committee members argued that it would provide much-needed relief to congested roads, while others felt that it would be a costly and environmentally detrimental solution. The proposal ultimately failed to pass with a vote of 4-3.

Additionally, the committee discussed several other proposals, including:

* **Increased funding for pedestrian infrastructure**
* **Expansion of the city's car-sharing program**
* **Improvement of bus shelters and stops**

These items were approved without controversy.
