#### Summary
The Transportation Committee meeting covered several key topics:

* The committee discussed the proposed bike-share program for the city, with a budget allocation of $250,000. While some members were in favor of the program, citing its potential to reduce traffic congestion and promote sustainability, others expressed concerns about the cost and whether it would be used effectively by residents.
* A presentation was given on the city's plans to improve pedestrian safety along major corridors, including the implementation of dedicated bus lanes and improved lighting. The plan is expected to be implemented in phases over the next two years.
* The committee also discussed a proposal to increase parking fees in downtown Saint Paul to help fund transportation projects. While some members supported the idea, citing the need for revenue generation, others argued that it would disproportionately affect low-income residents who rely on parking for work or daily activities.

A contentious point of discussion was the proposed bike-share program, with Committee Chairperson Nacre expressing concerns about the program's feasibility and cost-effectiveness. Councilor Maria Hernandez disputed these claims, arguing that a well-designed bike-share system could be an asset to the city. The committee ultimately decided to table the proposal for further review.

The meeting concluded with a vote on a resolution to allocate funds for transportation projects, which passed 5-2, with Committee members John Smith and Sarah Johnson dissenting due to concerns about the program's effectiveness in reducing traffic congestion.
