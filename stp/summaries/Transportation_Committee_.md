#### Summary
The Transportation Committee met to discuss several proposals for improving the city's transportation infrastructure. Key topics included:

* The proposed reconstruction of Snelling Avenue, which is expected to begin in spring 2024 and will include updates to sidewalks, bike lanes, and traffic signals.
* A request from a local business owner for improved parking options along Selby Avenue.
* An update on the city's electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure plan.

The committee also reviewed several budget proposals related to transportation projects. Notably:

* A $1 million allocation for upgrading traffic signals at key intersections throughout the city
* A $500,000 request from the Parks and Recreation department to install bike lanes along a section of Summit Avenue

Some members expressed concern about the timing of the Snelling Avenue project, citing potential disruptions to local businesses. Committee member Rachel Lee stated that "while we understand the need for infrastructure upgrades, we also need to consider the impact on our small business owners." The proposal will be sent to the full City Council for review and approval.

The committee voted 7-2 in favor of allocating funds for EV charging stations, with members John Smith and Maria Rodriguez opposing the measure. They expressed concerns about the cost-benefit analysis and potential competition from private companies offering similar services.
