#### Summary
The Transportation Committee meeting covered several key topics related to transportation in Saint Paul. One of the main discussions was about the proposed bike lane expansion on Summit Avenue. The plan aims to add more bike lanes and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure to improve safety and accessibility.

Committee members discussed budget allocations for various projects, including a $1 million proposal for street lighting upgrades in high-crime areas. This move was met with support from most committee members, but Councilor [Noecker] expressed concerns about the allocation, stating that more funding should be directed towards community programs rather than infrastructure.

A heated debate arose regarding the proposed ban on private cars in downtown Saint Paul during peak hours. Committee member Councilor [Smith] argued that this measure would reduce congestion and improve air quality, while others like Councilor [Johnson] countered that it would disproportionately affect low-income residents who rely on their cars for transportation.

The committee also discussed a new initiative to increase public transportation options, including potential partnerships with the Minnesota Transit Authority. While some members expressed enthusiasm for the idea, others raised concerns about the feasibility and cost of such a plan.

In other business, the committee heard an update on the city's snow removal efforts, which were deemed satisfactory by most members. However, one member pointed out that more could be done to address the issue of abandoned vehicles clogging city streets during winter months.

The meeting concluded with a vote on the proposed bike lane expansion plan, which passed 8-2. The next Transportation Committee meeting is scheduled for April 11th at 6:00 PM.
