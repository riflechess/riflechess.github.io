#### Meeting Info
Type: Committee of the Whole (CIB) meeting
Purpose: Review city budget, discuss neighborhood projects, and address resident concerns
Date/Time: Thursday, September 15, 2026 at 7:00 PM
Location: Arlington Hills Community Center, Saint Paul


#### Summary
The CIB meeting began with a review of the proposed 2027 city budget. Notable allocations include:

* $1 million for street repair in Frogtown and Summit-University neighborhoods
* $750,000 for affordable housing initiatives
* $200,000 for park improvements in Phalen Park

Residents expressed concerns about crime rates and public safety in the area. The police chief briefed on recent efforts to address these issues:

* Increased patrols in high-crime areas
* Community engagement programs to build trust between law enforcement and residents

A contentious topic arose when some residents questioned the city's decision to partner with a private developer for a new affordable housing project in the Payne-Phalen neighborhood. Concerns centered around potential gentrification, displacement of existing residents, and the fairness of the selection process.

The CIB voted on the budget allocations, with all items passing except for one:

* The $1 million street repair allocation for Frogtown was approved by a vote of 7-2, with Council Members Thompson and Lee dissenting due to concerns about the project's potential impact on local businesses.
* A motion to increase funding for community engagement programs was tabled until the next meeting.

Other discussions included updates on neighborhood projects, such as the ongoing revitalization of the West Seventh Street commercial corridor. The CIB also heard from residents about issues with trash collection and parking enforcement in their neighborhoods.
