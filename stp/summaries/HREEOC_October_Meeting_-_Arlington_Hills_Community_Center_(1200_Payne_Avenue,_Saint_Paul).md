#### Summary

The HREEOC meeting on October 10 focused on two main proposals:

* The first proposal aimed to update the historic preservation ordinance to include more inclusive guidelines for adaptive reuse of historic buildings. Committee members discussed potential changes to the zoning code and permitting process.
* The second proposal centered around a proposed development project in the Cathedral Hill neighborhood, which would involve renovating a historic building into condominiums.

During the discussion on the second proposal, some committee members expressed concerns about the potential impact on local businesses and parking issues. There was also debate over the need for more community input in the planning process.

* Committee Chair stated that public outreach is crucial but asked if sufficient outreach has been done.
* A member noted that this project's review is necessary to ensure it aligns with the city's goals of revitalizing neighborhoods.

The committee voted on a motion to proceed with further study and discussion, with 5 members voting in favor and 2 against. The dissenting members expressed concerns about lack of community input and potential negative effects on local businesses.

Next steps will be determined after receiving written feedback from HREEOC members and stakeholders.
