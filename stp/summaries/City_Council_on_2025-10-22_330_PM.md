#### Summary

The meeting began with a presentation by the Executive Director of Tyco Arts Midwest, Jennifer Weir, who spoke about their organization's goal to establish a permanent home in North End St. Paul for their Japanese drumming performances and multipurpose event space. The Council members expressed support for the proposal, and Resolution 25-1643 was approved.

The meeting then moved on to recognize Domestic Violence Awareness Month, with Shelley Klein from the St. Paul Intervention Project speaking about the important work of her organization in supporting victims of domestic violence. The Council members acknowledged the life-saving work of SPIP and declared October 2025 as Domestic Violence Awareness Month in the City of St. Paul.

The meeting also discussed the budget for public safety, with a focus on housing and community development initiatives. A total of $10 million is allocated to housing, including $5 million for office-to-housing conversions and $1 million for commercial corridors.

The Council also considered several resolutions related to infrastructure projects, including the reconstruction of University Avenue between I-35E and Lafayette Road. The project involves acquiring permanent right-of-way easements from five properties along the south side of the street.

Additionally, a public hearing was held on Ordinance 25-61, amending Chapter 74 of the Legislative Code by designating the Theodore Hamm Brewery Company Heritage Preservation District as a heritage preservation site. Michelle Taylor and Ashley Bisner testified in support of the proposal, and the Council members laid over the item until November 5th for further consideration.

The meeting concluded with good news from around the city, including the success of the Grand Avenue first common-send project and upcoming Halloween events. The Council also acknowledged the efforts of their legislative aide, Melanie Johnson, on her birthday.
