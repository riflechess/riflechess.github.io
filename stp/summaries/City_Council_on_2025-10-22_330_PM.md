#### Summary
The meeting began with a discussion on downtown Saint Paul's revitalization efforts. The city council approved several resolutions and ordinances, including one supporting Tyco Arts Midwest's request for a permanent home in the North End neighborhood.

A resolution was adopted to declare October as Domestic Violence Awareness Month in St. Paul. The St. Paul Intervention Project (SPIP) staff spoke about their work and thanked the city council for their support.

The meeting also addressed infrastructure projects, including the Heights project site. Several ordinance permits were approved under suspension of the rules, allowing for roadway and sidewalk infrastructure to be installed by the St. Paul Port Authority.

A proposed ordinance aimed at reducing gun violence in St. Paul was presented, which would ban public possession of assault weapons, large capacity magazines, and binary triggers, as well as require serial numbers on all firearms. The city attorney will provide clarification on parts of the ordinance that can take effect earlier.

Public hearings were held for several items, including a proposal to create a heritage preservation district at the Theodore Hamm Brewery Company site, and resolutions related to grant funds and street sweeping stewardship grants.

The meeting concluded with good news from around the city, including a Halloween walkthrough event and a candlelight vigil for victims of domestic violence.
