#### Summary

The meeting covered several important topics related to city ordinances, resolutions, and consent agenda items. The first item on the agenda was a public hearing on Ordinance 24-21, which aims to amend the zoning code chapters 60, 63, 65, and 66 pertaining to adult use cannabis. Several community members spoke in opposition to the ordinance due to concerns about odor issues related to cannabis cultivation and manufacturing.

The council also discussed Resolution 24-226, approving the application of R. Michael Wright for a sound-level variance in order to present live amplified sound on September 14th, 2024, on Selby Avenue from Chatwood Street North to Victoria Street North. Several community members spoke in support of the variance, and it was ultimately approved.

The meeting also included a discussion on Resolution 24-228, approving the application of Minnesota United FC for a sound-level variance application. However, no one spoke in opposition or in favor, and it was approved by a voice vote.

Another key item on the agenda was the public hearing on item number 34, which pertained to the rehabilitation or removal of structures at 455 Robert Street South. The council heard from several community members, including Thomas Radio, an attorney representing Allstate Properties, who spoke in favor of keeping the building and allowing it to be rehabilitated.

The council ultimately voted to send the issue back to legislative hearing on October 22nd, with a report due to Council on October 23rd. The abatement plan would include installation of black vinyl-coated fencing, an alarm system, and lighting, as well as giving the owner another 60 days to bring forward a complete rehab plan.

#### Highlights

* **Cannabis Ordinance**: The public hearing on Ordinance 24-21 was contentious, with several community members speaking in opposition due to concerns about odor issues related to cannabis cultivation and manufacturing.
* **Nuisance Abatement Plan**: The council voted to send the issue of rehabilitation or removal of structures at 455 Robert Street South back to legislative hearing, requiring a nuisance abatement plan that includes installation of black vinyl-coated fencing, an alarm system, and lighting.

#### Debate on Nuisance Abatement Plan
The debate surrounding item number 34 was intense. Ms. Mormon proposed sending the issue back to legislative hearing for further discussion, with the goal of developing a nuisance abatement plan. However, Councilwoman Naker opposed this proposal, arguing that it would allow the property owner to delay rehabilitation efforts indefinitely.

Ms. Mormon countered by suggesting that a short-term extension could be granted if the property owner demonstrates meaningful progress toward rehabilitating the building. She also proposed that the council require installation of black vinyl-coated fencing and an alarm system as part of the abatement plan.

Councilwoman Aker expressed support for Ms. Mormon's proposal, stating that the goal should be to find a solution that balances the need for rehabilitation with the concerns of the community.

The motion to send the issue back to legislative hearing was eventually approved by a voice vote, with Councilwoman Naker seconding it.
