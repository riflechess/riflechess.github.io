#### Summary
The meeting began with the approval of minutes from the previous meeting. The main agenda items were updates on two development projects in Saint Paul.

**Project 1: Joseph's Point**
The first item was an update on the Joseph's Point project, which involves the acquisition and preservation of 90 affordable housing units at 200 Wilkins Street. A technical action related to updated bond structure for the project was approved with no additional funding.

**Project 2: 652 Sherburn Avenue Loan Extension Request**
Hannah Chong presented a loan extension request for the 652 Sherburn development, which is a rehabilitation of a vacant building in District 7, Ward 1. The request is to extend the maturity date of a spending plan TIF loan from December 31st, 2025 to June 30th, 2026, with no additional funding.

**Project 3: Inspiring Communities Project at 560 Brunson Street**
Joel Mulsalf presented an introduction to the Inspiring Communities Project at 560 Brunson Street. The project involves building four townhouses for ownership, each containing three bedrooms, two and a half baths, and a two-car garage. A developer, Amani Construction and Development, is requesting additional funding of $87,313 due to unexpected challenges during the site plan review process.

The HRA has previously authorized $1,145,059 of gross subsidy for this project, and the developer is requesting an increase in the development cost to $1,232,372. Commissioner Aker expressed support for the project but noted that regulation and process have caused costs to go up for affordable housing projects. The HRA staff confirmed that the project is ready to proceed with approval of the additional subsidy.

The meeting concluded with the adjournment of the Housing Redevelopment Authority meeting.
