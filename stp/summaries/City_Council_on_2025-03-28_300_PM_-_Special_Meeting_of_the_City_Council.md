#### Summary
The City Council met in a special session on March 28th to discuss and vote on an interim council member for Ward 4. However, the meeting was adjourned without taking any action due to controversy surrounding a resolution that had been amended on Wednesday.

Council President (corrected from Nacre) expressed frustration with actions taken by some members during a previous meeting, which led one candidate to withdraw from the process. The Council President then withdrew the resolution, giving the council more time to reach consensus on the issue.

A point of order was raised regarding sponsorship of the resolution, but it did not change the outcome. The meeting was adjourned without further action being taken.
