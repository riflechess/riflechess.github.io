#### Meeting Info
**Meeting Type:** CIB (Community Improvement Board) Meeting
**Purpose:** To discuss various community projects, budget allocations, and public safety initiatives in the city's Arlington Hills neighborhood
**Date/Time:** August 15, 2026, 7:00 PM at the Arlington Hills Community Center

#### Summary
The meeting started with an update on the Arlington Hills Park renovation project. The board approved a budget increase of $100,000 to cover unforeseen expenses. This brings the total budget for the project to $750,000.

The board also discussed the proposed establishment of a community garden in the neighborhood. While some members expressed enthusiasm for the idea, others raised concerns about maintenance and liability. A motion was made to approve the plan, but it failed to pass due to lack of consensus (5-4 vote). The issue will be revisited at the next CIB meeting.

Regarding public safety, the board discussed a proposal to install additional streetlights in high-crime areas. The proposal was met with support from most members, and a motion was made to allocate $200,000 for the project. The motion passed unanimously (8-0).

Other notable items:

* A request from local business owners to extend parking meter hours on weekends was tabled until further discussion.
* A resident expressed concerns about noise pollution from a nearby construction site. City officials agreed to investigate and provide a follow-up report.

The next CIB meeting is scheduled for September 12, 2026.
