#### Summary

A total of four agenda items were discussed during this meeting.

* **Item 1: Budget Update**: The committee received an update on the current year's budget and made some adjustments to ensure that funds are allocated efficiently. A motion was made to allocate $500,000 for a new affordable housing project in the Midway area.
* **Item 2: Public Safety Initiative**: The HREEOC members discussed a proposal to partner with the Saint Paul Police Department on a public safety initiative aimed at reducing crime rates in high-risk neighborhoods. Some members expressed concerns about the potential impact of increased police presence on community relationships, but ultimately voted in favor of moving forward with the partnership.
* **Item 3: Community Engagement Plan**: The committee reviewed and approved a new community engagement plan to improve communication and outreach efforts between HREEOC and local communities.

A contentious discussion took place during Item 2 when some members expressed concerns that the initiative might lead to over-policing in minority neighborhoods. Councilor X suggested that the city should focus on addressing systemic issues rather than relying solely on increased police presence. The motion to move forward with the partnership passed, but with a close vote of 5-4.

No major decisions were made regarding tax proposals or business-related matters during this meeting.
