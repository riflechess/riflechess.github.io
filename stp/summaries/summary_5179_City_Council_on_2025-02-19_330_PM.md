#### Summary
The meeting covered several topics, including resolutions honoring community members and developers, variances for Highland Bridge development, rezoning requests, and grant funding. The council approved resolutions to honor Frank White's contributions to African American history in St. Paul and to recognize the Rice Larmander Vision Plan partnership between Saint Paul, Roseville, and Maplewood.

The city council also considered appeals from Ryan Companies regarding variances for their Highland Bridge development project. Council Member Jost argued that the BZA erred in fact-finding and procedure, while Council Members Yang and Nacre disagreed, citing the comprehensive plan and practical difficulties as reasons to deny the appeal. The motion failed due to a tie vote.
