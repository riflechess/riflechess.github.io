#### Summary
The Housing and Redevelopment Authority (HRA) meeting discussed two conduit bond projects for local charter schools. The first project is for Nova Classical Academy, which seeks to issue up to $25 million in conduit revenue bonds to refinance a portion of its prior bonds and finance an expansion of its school facility. The proposed project includes the construction of a new building with approximately 28,000 square feet, primarily consisting of a storm shelter, locker rooms, office space, meeting space, and flexible classroom space.

The second project is for Twin Cities Academy, which seeks to issue up to $15 million in conduit revenue bonds to refinance its prior bonds issued in 2015. The refinancing will reduce annual bond payments through an extension of the final maturity date from July 1, 2050, to July 1, 2065.

Both projects were introduced by Director Jenny Wolfe and Ms. Ginny Wolfe, respectively, and presented by their respective executive directors: Dr. Brett Wedlin (Nova Classical Academy) and Ms. Betsy Luth (Twin Cities Academy).

The HRA board voted unanimously to approve the resolution for Nova Classical Academy's settlement agreement with Ray Collins and Carolyn J. Collins in Ward 1, District 8.

For both projects, the HRA will hold public hearings next week on August 20th, and the city council will also need to take action on that same date. The anticipated closing dates for both projects are in October (Nova Classical Academy) and September (Twin Cities Academy).

Overall, the meeting focused on discussing the details of these two conduit bond projects and ensuring that they align with HRA policies and procedures.
