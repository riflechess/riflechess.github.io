#### Summary

The meeting began with a discussion on the proposed zoning appeal for a new mixed-use development on Payne Avenue. The proposal involves demolishing an existing building and constructing a new structure with commercial space and apartments. After hearing from the developer and neighbors, the PCIARC voted to approve the project with certain conditions.

Key decisions made during the meeting include:

* Approval of the Payne Avenue zoning appeal with conditions (6-0 vote)
* Denial of a zoning appeal for a single-family home in the Highland Park neighborhood due to concerns about lot size and setback requirements (4-1 vote)

There was some contention surrounding the denial of the Highland Park zoning appeal. Commissioner Johnson expressed concerns that the decision would set a precedent for future developments, while Commissioner Rodriguez argued that the existing zoning regulations were clear and should be enforced.

No budget allocations or tax proposals were discussed during this meeting. Public safety was not mentioned as an agenda item.
