**Summary**

The meeting began with a brief discussion of labor relations and contract approvals. The HR director and deputy director provided a briefing on the importance of understanding the context behind consent agenda votes.

The council then moved on to discussing Resolution 25-630, which recognized the 20th annual Hmong National Development Conference's theme "We Rise United" and celebrated 50 years of Hmong community leadership in the US. Councilor Johnson presented the resolution and thanked her colleagues for their support.

Next, the council discussed Resolution 25-643, which approved a partial loan forgiveness of up to $238,994.88 in combined principal and interest on a city mortgage to the Commerce Building Phase 1 and Commerce Building Phase 2 projects. Laura Hanson from PED presented a brief staff report explaining the reasoning behind the request.

The council also addressed Item 12, APC 25-1, which considered the appeal by the University of St. Thomas to the decision of the Planning Commission regarding drive access from Goodrich Avenue. Councilor Provrotsky motioned to approve the appeal and modify Condition 16 of the 2004 permit to allow the driveway in question to remain.

The meeting then shifted to Item 13, final adoption of Ordinance 25-21, which granted the application of Central Internal Medicine Associates, PA, to rezone property at 635 Cleveland Avenue South from OS Office Surface to T2 Traditional Neighborhood. Councilor Jost motioned to approve this item, and it passed unanimously.

**Highlights**

* **Breakaway Music Festival:** The council held a public hearing on Resolution Public Hearing 25-62, which approved the application of Breakaway Music Festival for sound level variance in order to present amplified sound on June 6th through June 7th at Allianz Field Grounds. Jared Fucci, President of Breakaway Music Festival, presented an overview of the festival and addressed concerns regarding noise levels.
* **Sound Level Variance:** The council discussed and voted on Resolution Public Hearing 25-62, which approved a sound level variance for the Breakaway Music Festival. The resolution was amended to allow for a higher decibel level than initially proposed, but with conditions to minimize impact on surrounding communities.

**Notable Contention**

* Councilor Johnson expressed concerns that the council should have laid over the discussion of Resolution Public Hearing 25-62 and held further discussions before voting.
* Councilor Provrotsky motioned to reopen the public hearing for a yes-or-no vote from the Breakaway Music Festival organizers, but it was ultimately voted down.
