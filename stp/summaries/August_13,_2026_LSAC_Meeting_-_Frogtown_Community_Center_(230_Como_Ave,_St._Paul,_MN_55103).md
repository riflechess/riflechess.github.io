#### Meeting Info

* Type: Livestreamed public meeting of the Local Sustainability Advisory Committee (LSAC)
* Purpose: Discuss sustainable initiatives and provide updates on ongoing projects

* Location: Frogtown Community Center (230 Como Ave, St. Paul, MN 55103)

#### Summary

The LSAC meeting focused on several key topics related to sustainability in Saint Paul.

* **Green Infrastructure Project**: The committee approved a $200,000 budget allocation for the Green Infrastructure Project, which aims to improve stormwater management and reduce flooding in low-lying areas.
* **Community Garden Initiative**: The initiative was introduced to establish community gardens in underserved neighborhoods. The proposal included a $50,000 grant request to support the project.
* **Electric Vehicle Charging Stations**: A discussion on installing electric vehicle charging stations in public parking lots was held. Some committee members expressed concerns about potential maintenance costs and infrastructure requirements.

A contentious debate arose during the discussion on community garden initiative funding. Committee member Rachel Jenkins argued that the grant request should be increased to $75,000, citing rising food prices and increased demand for fresh produce. She suggested redirecting funds from other initiatives to support this project. The proposal was ultimately tabled until the next meeting for further review.

The meeting concluded with a unanimous decision to prioritize community outreach and engagement for future sustainability projects.
