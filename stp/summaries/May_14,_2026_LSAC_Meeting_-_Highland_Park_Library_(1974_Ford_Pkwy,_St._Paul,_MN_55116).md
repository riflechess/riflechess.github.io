#### Summary
The meeting began with an update from the City Planning Department on upcoming developments in the city. The main agenda item was a proposal for a new apartment complex in the Frogtown neighborhood.

The developer presented their plans, which include 200 units of mixed-income housing, commercial space, and community amenities. The proposal also includes a request for a zoning change to allow for higher density development.

After discussion, the LSAC voted on whether to recommend approval of the proposal. The vote was 7-2 in favor of recommending approval, with Councillor Johnson and Councillor Thompson dissenting. They expressed concerns about the impact of increased density on local infrastructure and community character.

A motion was also made to request that the City Planning Department study the feasibility of incorporating more affordable housing units into future developments. This motion passed unanimously.

Other topics discussed included:

* A proposal for a new parking garage in the downtown area, which was tabled until further review
* A request from local business owners for improved street lighting and security measures in the Summit-University neighborhood
* An update on the city's efforts to address homelessness, including new initiatives and partnerships with local organizations

Overall, the meeting focused on land use proposals and their impact on the city's communities. The LSAC will continue to review and provide recommendations on these proposals as they move forward through the development process.
