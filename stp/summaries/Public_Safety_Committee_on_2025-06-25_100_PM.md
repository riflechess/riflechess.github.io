#### Summary

The meeting started with an introduction by Chair Bowie, who expressed pride in establishing the Public Safety Committee. The first agenda item was bringing awareness to National Gun Violence Awareness Month, presented by the Office of Neighborhood Safety (ONS). Director Blakey introduced community partners, including World Youth Connect, Hired, and Moms Demand Action, which work on gun prevention and violence reduction initiatives.

The second agenda item was staff report 25-114, Safe Summer Nights Events. Commander McCabe from the St. Paul Police Department presented an overview of the event, which started 12 years ago with a breakfast meeting between Tom Campion and then-Chief Todd Axtell. The event has evolved to provide community services, including resource tables, public health outreach, and financial security advice.

The third agenda item was recruitment and retention in the St. Paul Fire Department. Assistant Chief Jeremiah Milquist presented on the importance of recruitment and training in maintaining a well-trained and diverse team. He discussed the department's efforts to improve readiness, including extending lead time and academy duration. The presentation also highlighted the use of affinity groups, such as Twin Cities Female Firefighter Fitness (TCF3), Firefighters United, and Los Bomberos, to recruit and retain firefighters.

The committee then discussed the hiring process for the fire department, with Assistant Chief Milquist explaining that tests are now conducted every one to two years. The discussion also touched on the use of overtime to backfill positions during training, as well as the expansion of BLS (Basic Life Support) to support operational needs.

The meeting concluded with a presentation by Assistant Chief Milquist on strategic overhiring, which aims to hire 12-20 above the FTE cap to reduce overtime and fill gaps in staffing. The committee also discussed the importance of investing in people, planning, and places to maintain a well-functioning department that reflects the community it serves.

Overall, the meeting focused on public safety initiatives, including gun violence prevention, Safe Summer Nights Events, and recruitment and retention in the St. Paul Fire Department.
