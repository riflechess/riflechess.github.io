#### Summary

The meeting began with a discussion on the scope of work for an upcoming audit on data practices in the City of Saint Paul, led by Dr. Heather Britt. The revised scope was presented, which includes assessing the effectiveness, efficiency, and compliance of the city's data practices, request processes, tools, policies, and user experience, particularly focusing on the use of GOV QA.

The committee discussed potential stakeholders for the audit, including frequent requesters to the Department of Safety and Inspections, state and external entities, and other Minnesota jurisdictions. Dr. Britt mentioned that a survey would be conducted to gather information from these stakeholders, with a focus on the resident-facing experience in the portal.

Regarding community engagement efforts, Mr. McVeigh reported on his outreach to district councils, with some positive responses but also significant challenges in getting them to participate. He suggested reaching out to council members and their staff for further assistance. The committee discussed ideas for promoting the topic selection survey and filling a vacant community advisor position.

The meeting concluded with a discussion on the timeline for filling the vacant community advisor position, with Ms. Bang proposing a four-week application period due to the holidays. The committee agreed to post the application on December 3rd and have interviews on January 20th.
