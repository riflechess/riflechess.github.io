#### Summary

The meeting began with a discussion on the revised scope of work for an upcoming audit on data practices in Saint Paul. Dr. Britt presented the updated scope, which focuses on assessing the effectiveness, efficiency, and compliance of the city's data practices, including its use of GOV QA and alignment with the Minnesota Data Practices Act requirements.

The committee discussed stakeholder engagement, including a survey to gather feedback from frequent requesters through the Department of Safety and Inspections. They also reviewed the scope of work, which includes document and system reviews, performance data analysis, model policies, and benchmarking.

Regarding community engagement, Mr. McVeigh reported on his efforts to reach out to district councils, with some responses received from West 7th Fort Road Federation, Como Park District, and Highland District Council. He proposed meeting with these councils next month to discuss the audit committee's work.

The topic selection process was briefly discussed, but no major changes were suggested. The committee then turned its attention to the community advisor appointment timeline, which is currently open due to Mr. Frenchworth's departure. A new application will be posted on December 3rd, and interviews are planned for January 20th, with a goal of having a new member seated by March.

A combined posting for topic selection and community advisor applications was proposed, which would promote both opportunities in one announcement. This idea was met with support from the committee members, and a revised blurb will be drafted to incorporate both messages.
