#### Summary
The Heritage Preservation Commission reviewed two applications: one for 722 6th Street East, which involves reconstructing the front porch of a Leslie Helms House in the Dayton's Bluff Heritage Preservation District; and another pre-application at 2010 Summit Avenue, proposing to demolish a garage and construct an ADU (Accessory Dwelling Unit) with a rear addition.

**Decision for 722 6th Street East:**
The commission approved the application with conditions. The original design was deemed too simplistic, and staff recommended requiring a base and capital on the columns or using square columns with architectural details at the top and bottom. After discussion, the commissioners agreed to add an additional condition regarding the column design.

**Decision for 2010 Summit Avenue:**
The commission discussed the pre-application but did not make a decision. The applicants presented their design concept, which aimed to maintain the character of the Tudor Revival house while updating it with modern features. The commission provided feedback and suggestions, including using a more rustic grade for the half timbering on the garage.

**Other Matters:**
The commission also discussed the Stroh's Brewery building, which was previously denied by the State Review Board due to an owner objection. The city is still seeking eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places and potential tax credits through the IRS. However, there appears to be a lack of trust among some stakeholders, making progress difficult.

The meeting concluded with a motion to adjourn.
