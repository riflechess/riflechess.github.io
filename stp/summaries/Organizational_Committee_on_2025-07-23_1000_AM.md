#### Meeting Info
**Meeting Type:** Organizational Committee
**Date/Time:** 2025-07-23 10:00 AM
**Purpose:** Review of vacant building program, audit presentation by State Auditor Julie Blaha and discussion on related matters.

#### Summary

The meeting started with a presentation by the State Auditor's office, led by Deputy Auditor Chad Struce. They explained the purpose and process of an audit, including how they identify and address issues such as material weaknesses and significant deficiencies. The auditor also discussed the timeline for completing audits and the importance of receiving all necessary materials on time.

The committee then moved on to discuss the vacant building program in St. Paul. Marcia Mormon, Legislative Hearing Officer, presented an overview of the program's history, benefits, and challenges. David Hoban, Deputy Director of the Department of Safety and Inspections, discussed the various categories of vacant buildings (Category 1-3) and the fees associated with each.

The presentation highlighted the importance of record keeping and due process in managing vacant buildings. It also emphasized the need for consistency and clear expectations in dealing with property owners. However, the committee noted that there are challenges to the program, including:

*   Slow time and resource-intensive processes
*   Consistency issues and potential biases in enforcement
*   Limited access to information and services for marginalized communities

Council Member Povraski commended staff on their thorough presentation and expressed appreciation for the history and context provided. He also noted that the vacant building program often gets talked about as if it's an official meaning (Capital V Capital B) when in fact, many buildings referred to as vacant are not technically part of the program.

Council Member Povraski recommended adjusting or prioritizing the following:

*   Focusing on taking down buildings that are in the absolute worst shape and those that have been on the list for an excessively long time
*   Considering properties like these to be opportunities for new six-family homes or four-family homes

The meeting concluded with a deep gratitude to staff for their work and a decision to adjourn the Organizational Committee.
