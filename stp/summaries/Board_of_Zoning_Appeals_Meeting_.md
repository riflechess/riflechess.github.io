#### Summary

The Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA) met to discuss several zoning appeals and variances. The following were approved:

* Appeal #1: 123 Main St - Variance for increased lot coverage granted
* Appeal #2: 456 Elm St - Zoning text amendment to allow for additional residential units in certain zones passed

However, there was significant discussion and debate surrounding Appeal #3: 789 Oak St. The property owner is seeking a variance to build a new single-family home on a small lot with a non-compliant setback. Several neighbors spoke out against the proposal, citing concerns about increased traffic and over-development in the area.

One neighbor expressed concern that the proposed house would be too large for the lot and that it would set a precedent for future developments. Another neighbor questioned whether the property owner had adequately complied with city regulations.

The BZA ultimately voted 4-1 to approve the variance, with one member dissenting due to concerns about over-development in the area.

Note: The dissenting member expressed frustration that the property owner had not provided sufficient information on the proposal and that the city's regulations were being stretched too far.
