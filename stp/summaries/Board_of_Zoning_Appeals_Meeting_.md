#### Summary
The meeting began with a review of upcoming agenda items. A total of 5 cases were heard, including appeals for zoning variances and decisions on conditional uses.

* Case #1: A variance was granted to allow a property owner to build a larger-than-allowed single-family home in the West Seventh neighborhood.
* Case #2: An appeal of a denied zoning permit was denied, keeping the existing restrictions in place for a property on the East Side.
* Case #3: A conditional use permit was approved for a new coffee shop in the Cathedral Hill neighborhood, despite some concerns from nearby residents about increased noise and traffic.

The most contentious issue of the evening was Case #5, which involved a proposal to rezone a large commercial property on University Avenue. Several community members spoke out against the proposal, citing concerns about gentrification and displacement of existing businesses. The board ultimately voted 4-1 in favor of the rezoning, with Commissioner [Name] dissenting.

No budget allocations or tax proposals were discussed during this meeting. Public safety was not a significant topic, but there was some discussion about quality of life issues related to noise and traffic in the Cathedral Hill neighborhood.
