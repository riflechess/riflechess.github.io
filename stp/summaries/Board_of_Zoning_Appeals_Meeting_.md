**Date/Time:** [Insert Date and Time]
**Location:** City Hall, 15 W Kellogg Blvd, St Paul, MN 55102

#### Summary
The meeting began with a review of pending cases. The board heard an appeal from a resident in the Midway neighborhood who is requesting a variance to build a second-story addition on their home. The proposed addition exceeds the city's zoning regulations for setbacks and height.

After discussion, the board voted 4-1 to approve the variance, citing exceptional circumstances due to the property's unique topography. The dissenting member expressed concerns about setting a precedent for similar variances in the future.

Additionally, the board reviewed a case involving a proposed new development on University Avenue. The applicant is seeking a zoning change to allow for a 5-story building with commercial space and residential units above. The board tabled the decision until their next meeting to allow for further review of traffic concerns raised by nearby residents.

No budget or tax proposals were discussed during this meeting.
