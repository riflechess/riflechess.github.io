#### Summary

The meeting began with a brief review of the agenda, which included three appeal cases. The first case involved a request for a variance to build a two-story addition on a residential property in the Highland neighborhood.

The applicant argued that the addition was necessary due to a family member's medical condition and would not impact neighboring properties. After hearing testimony from both sides, the board voted 4-1 to approve the variance with conditions.

The second case involved a request for a zoning text amendment to allow for more flexibility in mixed-use development projects. The applicant argued that the current regulations were too restrictive and hindered economic growth in certain areas of the city. However, some neighbors expressed concerns about increased traffic and density.

Despite these concerns, the board voted 3-2 to approve the text amendment with modifications to address some of the neighbor's concerns. The third case was a request for a variance to build a fence on a property line, which was approved unanimously.

Overall, the meeting focused on balancing individual property rights with community concerns and regulations. While there were differences in opinion, the board worked collaboratively to make informed decisions that reflected the needs of all stakeholders involved.
