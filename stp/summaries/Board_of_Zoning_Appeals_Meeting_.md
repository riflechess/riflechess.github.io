#### Summary
The Board of Zoning Appeals met to consider several zoning-related appeals. The main items discussed were:

* Appeal #1: Request to rezone a property in the Highland Park neighborhood from R-2 (single-family) to C-2 (commercial)
	+ The applicant argued that the current zoning was too restrictive and would limit their ability to develop a small commercial space.
	+ A neighbor spoke against the proposal, citing concerns about increased traffic and noise.
* Appeal #2: Request to allow a second-story addition in a historic district
	+ The owner argued that the addition was necessary due to an increase in family size.
	+ An Historic Preservation Commissioner expressed concern about the potential impact on the building's historic integrity.

The board voted on both appeals:

* Appeal #1: Approved with conditions (4-0)
* Appeal #2: Denied (3-1)
