#### Summary
The meeting began with a discussion on two separate zoning appeals. The first appeal was regarding a variance request for a property on the West Side to build a three-story residential building, which is exceeding the allowed height limit by 10 feet. The applicant argued that the increased height would allow for more efficient use of space and provide additional housing options.

The second appeal concerned a property in the Summit Hill neighborhood seeking a zoning change to establish a small home brewery on the premises. The applicant emphasized the potential economic benefits and unique character it could bring to the area.

After reviewing both cases, the board voted to approve the variance for the West Side property but denied the zoning change request for the brewery. The decision was made after considering input from neighbors, city planners, and public health officials.

It's worth noting that some attendees expressed concerns about increased density on the West Side, citing potential overcrowding and strain on local infrastructure. However, others argued that it would provide much-needed housing options in a rapidly developing area. In contrast, there was strong opposition to the brewery proposal from nearby residents who feared noise pollution and disruption of the neighborhood's character.

The board will continue reviewing zoning decisions and appeals at their next meeting.
