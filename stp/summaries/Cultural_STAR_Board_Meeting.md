#### Summary
The Cultural STAR Board Meeting focused on reviewing the past year's cultural events and initiatives in Saint Paul. The board discussed plans for upcoming festivals, including the Saint Paul Winter Carnival and the Minnesota State Fair.

A new project was proposed to create a public art installation in the Lowertown area, which would feature murals by local artists. The estimated cost of the project is $100,000, which would be covered by a combination of city funding and private donations.

The board also discussed a request from Nacre (Noecker) for additional funding to support her artistic residency program at the Saint Paul Public Library. While there was some discussion about the benefits of the program, not all members were convinced that it was worth the investment. A vote on the proposal resulted in 8-3 in favor of allocating $20,000 to support the program.

There was also a report from the city's cultural events coordinator regarding concerns about safety at outdoor events during extreme weather conditions. The board discussed possible solutions, including installing more emergency shelters and increasing communication with event attendees through social media.

Overall, the meeting focused on promoting arts and culture in Saint Paul, but also highlighted some of the challenges faced by organizers and attendees alike.
