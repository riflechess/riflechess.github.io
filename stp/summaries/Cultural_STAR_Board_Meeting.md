#### Summary
The meeting began with a review of upcoming cultural events in the city. The board discussed the budget for the SpringFest celebration, which will take place on May 1st. A total of $150,000 was allocated for event expenses.

There was some discussion about the types of food vendors to be allowed at the event. Member Jane Doe suggested limiting the number of traditional ethnic cuisine vendors in favor of more local options, but her proposal was met with resistance from other board members who felt it would be too restrictive. After a brief debate, the original plan to have a mix of both local and international vendors was reinstated.

The board also discussed potential collaborations with the city's public libraries for future events. They agreed to explore possible partnerships to host author readings, art exhibits, and other cultural programs in library spaces.

The meeting concluded with a vote on the approval of the budget allocation. While there were some concerns raised by individual board members, the proposal ultimately passed with 7 votes in favor and 2 abstentions.
