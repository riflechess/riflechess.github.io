#### Summary
The meeting began with an update on the upcoming SummerFest celebration, which will feature live music, food vendors, and cultural performances. The board discussed ways to promote diversity and inclusion in the event.

Regarding funding, the board voted to allocate $10,000 to support a new arts program for underprivileged youth. However, Councilor Nacre expressed concerns that this allocation might divert funds from other important initiatives.

In another matter, the board debated whether to partner with a local business to host a cultural festival in the Lowertown area. While some members saw it as an opportunity for economic growth and community engagement, others raised concerns about potential noise complaints and parking issues.

A proposed budget amendment to increase funding for the Saint Paul Festival of Nations was tabled until next month's meeting due to ongoing discussions around its impact on other cultural events in the city.

The board also discussed ways to improve accessibility at cultural venues, including the addition of wheelchair ramps and improved audio descriptions for visually impaired attendees. This discussion was well-received by all members present.
