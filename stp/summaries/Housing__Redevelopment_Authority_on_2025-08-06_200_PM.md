#### Summary

The meeting focused on reviewing the 2025 budget contingencies and updates on tenant protections and permit staffing. Chair Johnson highlighted the importance of transparency in addressing contingencies and expressed concern over the lack of clear responses from Director Risi.

Commissioner Bravotsky expressed support for the positions earmarked for tenant protection staffing and permit staffing, but noted that hiring processes can take time. Commissioner Provosky echoed similar sentiments, emphasizing the need to find a way to make these positions work despite accounting and money-moving complexities.

Chair Johnson clarified that the funds in question have not left the housing trust fund and that some of Director Risi's responses were aimed at addressing this "chicken and egg" situation. Commissioner Provosky suggested that the possibility for confusion might be due to the lack of clear communication about the two different contingencies.

The meeting concluded with an agreement to revisit the topic in a future council meeting, with Chair Johnson noting that there will likely be another resolution coming forward related to non-contingent budget amendments.

A significant point of contention arose from Director Risi's response to the memos, which Chair Johnson found inadequate. Commissioner Provosky also expressed concern over the lack of clear answers to questions regarding tenant protections and permit staffing.

Despite some disagreement, the meeting remained relatively brief and focused on finding solutions to address the contingencies and improve communication.
