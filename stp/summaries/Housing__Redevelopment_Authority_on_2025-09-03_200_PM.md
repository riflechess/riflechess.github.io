This is a transcript of a meeting between the City Council and the Housing Authority (HRA) in Madison, Wisconsin. The meeting was likely about the HRA's budget for the upcoming year.

Here are some key points from the meeting:

1. **Budget presentation**: Director Newton presented the HRA's proposed budget for the upcoming year. The presentation included an overview of the HRA's finances, including sources and uses of funds.
2. **Transfers from other departments**: The HRA relies on transfers from other city departments to fund its programs. However, these transfers are often unpredictable and can create budget holes in other departments.
3. **Diminishing sources of funding**: The HRA is facing declining revenue streams, including a reduction in federal funding for housing programs.
4. **Downtown development initiatives**: Director Newton discussed the HRA's efforts to revitalize downtown Madison through office-to-residential conversions and other development projects.
5. **Commissioner Yang's request**: Commissioner Yang asked for more information on how previous investments were spent and what results were achieved, so that they can make informed decisions about future budget allocations.

The meeting was adjourned after the City Council members expressed appreciation for the HRA's presentation and leadership, and agreed to follow up with additional questions and requests.
