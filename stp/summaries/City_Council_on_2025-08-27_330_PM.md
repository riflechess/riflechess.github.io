#### Summary

The meeting began with a moment of silence for the victims of gun violence in the community. The council welcomed new member Molly Coleman and approved the consent agenda items.

The main topic of discussion was the tree preservation ordinance, which has been in development for six months. Director Rodriguez and Kershaw presented on the progress made so far, including draft language, internal team work, and public engagement. They emphasized the importance of balancing tree preservation with infrastructure needs and developing a policy that is both effective and enforceable.

Council members discussed the complexity of implementing such an ordinance and how it interacts with external entities like state and federal agencies. The council decided to lay over the item until December 10th for further review.

The meeting also included public hearings on various resolutions, including one to approve the request of Energy Park Utility Company to amend rates and another to allow Nativity of Our Lord Catholic Parish School to present live amplified sound at their event. The council approved both resolutions after hearing from representatives from each organization.

A contentious issue arose during the discussion of a vacant building fee assessment on a property in the 1300 block of Hague Avenue. The owners, Bradley and Ashley Taylor, claimed that they had been confused about the letters they received regarding the assessment and that staff had told them to ignore the letters. They requested a reduction in the assessment from $5,075 to $2,537.

Council members discussed the issue and decided to lay over the item for two weeks to allow the owners to provide additional documentation of their attempts to communicate with staff about the assessment.

The meeting concluded with a public hearing on the balance of legislative hearing items, which were all approved by the council.
