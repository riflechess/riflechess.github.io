#### Summary

The meeting began with a moment of silence for the victims of gun violence in the community. The council then moved on to discuss the consent agenda items, which included appointing new council member Molly Coleman to various boards and commissions.

Next, the council discussed the final adoption of an ordinance amending title 4 of the administrative code to add chapter 92, title tree preservation for city-sponsored projects. Director Rodriguez and Director Kershaw provided updates on the progress made over the past six months, including the development of draft language and a public engagement process. The council agreed to lay over the item until December 10th.

The meeting also included discussion on the final adoption of ordinance 25-45, changing one block of Margaret Street from arcade street and east 7th street from a one-way street westbound to a two-way street in accordance with chapter 147 of the legislative code. The council unanimously approved this item.

In other matters, the council discussed a proposed amendment to chapter 130 of the city's legislative code, which governs the vacation of city right-of-way. This proposal aims to make the vacation process more efficient and streamlined for property owners and developers. A public hearing was scheduled for next week on this item.

The meeting also touched on various other items, including a request from Energy Park Utility Company to amend rates, and an application from Nativity of Our Lord Catholic Parish School for sound level variance at their county fair event.

A contentious issue arose during discussion of the vacant building fee assessment at 1350 Hague Avenue. The property owners, Bradley and Ashley Taylor, expressed confusion about the assessment process and claimed they had been misinformed by DSI staff. They argued that the vacant building fee should be reduced to $2,537 from the original $5,075 due to the misunderstanding.

The council ultimately decided to lay over this item for two weeks to allow additional information to be submitted by the property owners. This decision was met with some opposition from Council Member Johnson, who voted against the layover and expressed concerns about moving forward on the assessment matter.

Finally, the meeting concluded with a review of the legislative hearing consent agenda items, which were approved as amended after a public hearing.
