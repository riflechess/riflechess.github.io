#### Summary

The city council met to discuss various resolutions and ordinances. The most notable items discussed were:

* Resolution 25-681: Directing the city clerk to notify the county auditor to place a referendum on ordinance ORD 25-2 on the November ballot, with amendments made in response to public input.
* Resolution 25-1015: Honoring community partners and recognizing National Gun Violence Awareness Month. The council unanimously adopted this resolution after hearing from community groups and organizations working on gun violence prevention.
* Ordinance 25-36: Creating an additional commercial development district at 1624-1626 White Bear Avenue North. This ordinance was approved with a unanimous vote, with council members praising the business owners for their proactive approach to addressing concerns about safety and security.
* Resolution Public Hearing 25-122: Approving a sound level variance for the St. Paul Saints Baseball Club's Rock the Fourth event on July 4th at CHS Field. This resolution was adopted without opposition.
* Legislative hearing consent agenda items 22 through 28 were also discussed, including an amendment to ratify the assessment of vacant building registration fees billed during March 11th to October 17th, 2024.

A notable moment of contention arose when Ms. Lee, a property owner, testified about being unaware of mail from the city regarding vacant building fees. However, after reviewing the case, staff recommended that the council not amend the already ratified assessment rule but instead spread out the payment over five years, which was approved with a unanimous vote.

The meeting concluded with the council members expressing appreciation for the community partners and organizations working on gun violence prevention and welcoming the Right Track interns from Ward 1 and Ward 7.
