#### Summary

The meeting began with a discussion on Resolution 26-215, which defends the U.S. Constitution and the rule of law. The resolution was introduced by Council Member Yang and co-sponsored by Gary Fifield, a St. Paul resident. The resolution condemns the Trump administration's actions that undermine the rights of transgender, non-binary, and two-spirit individuals, including targeting medical care providers who offer legal, appropriate, and protected services in Minnesota.

The council voted to adopt the resolution with a 6-0 vote.

Next, the meeting discussed Resolution 25-1914, which outlines the city's 2026 legislative agenda. The resolution was presented by Jennifer O'Rourke, Director of Government Relations at the city. She explained that the city has made some additions and clarifications to the federal disruption and impacts language and added two new items related to public safety.

The council voted to adopt the resolution with a 6-0 vote.

Item number 16, Resolution 26-58, was presented by Council President Noecker. The resolution amends Appendix A2 of the Administrative Code relating to Council Committees. The changes made are technical in nature and reflect current practices of city council committees.

The council voted to adopt the resolution with a 6-0 vote.

Item number 17, Resolution 26-37, was discussed by Council Member Bowie. The resolution establishes the festivals and events security credit and streamlines and creates a centralized billing system for event organizers. However, the discussion was contentious, with some members questioning the administrative work involved in implementing the policy.

After some debate, the council voted to lay over the item for a two-week period.

Item number 18, Resolution 26-267, denounces the Trump administration's attack on gender-affirming care for youth. Council Vice President Kim presented the resolution and read it into record. The speakers from Outfront Minnesota and Gender Justice spoke in support of the resolution, highlighting its importance in protecting trans youth.

The council voted to adopt the resolution with a 6-0 vote.

Item number 19 was a public hearing on Ordinance 26-6, which requires law enforcement officers to visibly display identification on their uniforms. Council Member Yang presented the ordinance and explained its purpose.

The council voted to approve the final adoption of the ordinance with a 6-0 vote.

Item number 20 was a public hearing on Ordinance 26-8, amending section 86.01A of the St. Paul Administrative Code. David Eid from the Department of Safety and Inspections presented the staff report. The council took no action on this item as it is still in its second reading.

Items number 21 through 25 were resolutions related to sound level variances for events, which were approved with a vote.

Item number 26 was withdrawn as a duplicate of item number 23.

ABZA 26-1 was discussed next. The Minnesota Department of Administration appealed the decision made by the Board of Zoning Appeals regarding a zoning variance request. Council Member Yang asked questions about the timeline for making a final decision on this item, which is now laid over until February 18th.

Item number 28 was a public hearing on grievances related to federal immigration operations. Several speakers testified, including Ashley Van Duzerts and Megan Unruh, who called on the council to designate hospitals and ambulances as sanctuary sites where ICE is prohibited from conducting enforcement actions. The speakers also demanded that the St. Paul police department establish a publicly accountable process to address harm caused by its actions during these events.

The public hearing was continued until February 18th due to time constraints.

After the public hearing, Council Member Yang and Vice President Kim spoke on the importance of addressing hate speech in the council chambers, reaffirming their commitment to maintaining a safe and welcoming space for all residents.

Finally, the legislative hearing consent agenda items were approved with a vote.

The meeting concluded with news from Ward 7, where Chair Johnson announced that an additional $1.48 million is being allocated for emergency rental assistance programs.
