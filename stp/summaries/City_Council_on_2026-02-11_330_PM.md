#### Summary

The meeting started with a brief welcome and introduction by the Council President. The consent agenda was passed unanimously after a motion from Vice President Kim. Resolution 26-215, Defending the U.S. Constitution and the Rule of Law, was adopted unanimously after speakers from Common Cause Minnesota, Indivisible Twin Cities, and OutFront Minnesota spoke in support.

The second resolution discussed, Resolution 25-1914, outlining the city's 2026 legislative agenda, was also adopted unanimously after a staff report by Jennifer O'Rourke. The resolution includes support for state allocations to provide mitigation funds to businesses, nonprofits, and other community-serving entities affected by transportation and MnDOT street reconstruction projects.

Resolution 26-58, amending Appendix A2 of the Administrative Code relating to Council Committees, was approved as amended after a staff report by Mr. Greenfield. The resolution creates separate committees for budget council operations, policy committee, audit committee, and public safety committee, among others.

The city council also discussed Resolution 26-37, establishing the festivals and events security credit, which aims to provide reimbursement to eligible event organizers for security costs associated with festivals and events in St. Paul. However, this resolution was laid over for a two-week review due to concerns about its implementation.

Another resolution, denouncing the Trump administration's attack on gender-affirming care for youth, was adopted unanimously after a powerful speech by Vice President Kim. This resolution sends a strong message of support for the LGBTQ+ community in St. Paul and reaffirms the city's commitment to protecting their rights.

The council also passed a resolution urging hotels to not house federal immigration agents after a passionate plea from Sunrise Movement leaders. The resolution aims to raise awareness about the issue and encourage hotels to refrain from housing ICE agents.

Ordinance 26-6, adding Chapter 268A to the Legislative Code to require law enforcement officers performing law enforcement duties to visibly display identification on the outermost layer of their uniform, was adopted unanimously after a discussion by Council Vice President Kim.

The public hearing section of the meeting included discussions on various ordinances and resolutions related to zoning variances, public hearings, and grievances about federal immigration operations. The council also heard from numerous speakers who testified in support of safe zones, police accountability, and emergency rent assistance for families affected by Operation Metro Surge.

Unfortunately, one speaker used hate speech during the public hearing, targeting Council Vice President Kim, Council Member Bui, and the LGBTQ+ community. The council president and other members strongly condemned this behavior and reaffirmed their commitment to creating a safe and welcoming space for all individuals.

The meeting concluded with the adoption of the legislative hearing consent agenda items 29 through 38 after a motion from Ms. Bowie. The council also received news from Ward 7 that they have secured an additional $1.48 million for emergency rental assistance and that Council Member Johnson is committed to securing more resources to support St. Paul families.

Overall, this meeting was marked by powerful speeches, strong condemnations of hate speech, and a commitment to creating a safe and welcoming space for all individuals in the city of St. Paul.
