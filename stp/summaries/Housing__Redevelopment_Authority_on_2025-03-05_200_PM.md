#### Meeting Info
**Meeting Type:** Housing Redevelopment Authority (HRA) meeting
**Purpose:** Discussion and approval of various items related to housing redevelopment and financing
**Date/Time:** March 5, 2025, 2:00 PM
**Location:** Live and recorded public meeting for the City of Saint Paul

#### Summary
The meeting covered several key topics:

* **Avis Car Rental Lease**: The HRA approved a lease agreement with Avis car rental to occupy a small retail space in the Block 19 ramp. Staff recommended approval, citing the vacant space's potential impact on the area.
* **Land Donation at 1366 Fremont Avenue**: The HRA accepted a land donation from West Fargo Bank, N.A., and Leo of Payment of Demolition Assessment, District 4, Ward 7. Director Newton explained that the donated land would be used for residential development, potentially supporting five to six units of housing.
* **Commerce Building Phase 1 and 2**: Director Newton introduced a staff report on the Commerce Building sale, which included details about the property's history, current ownership structure, and proposed sale to Pack Properties. The meeting also discussed partial loan forgiveness of HRA debt related to the Commerce Building project.

Some key points from the discussion include:

* Commissioner Nacre asked about the mechanism for donating land in lieu of payment of a demolition assessment and received clarification that it was an unusual arrangement made possible by CDBG funds.
* Director Newton explained that repaying HRA loans would result in program income, which could be redeployed to support affordable housing projects.
* Laura Hainston clarified that while some resources might return sooner than expected due to the sale's timeline, the process of determining loan forgiveness and repayment terms involved negotiations with PED staff, leadership, and lenders.

Commissioner Nacre expressed strong support for the project, highlighting the local developer's experience in maintaining historic buildings and filling commercial spaces. The meeting concluded with a discussion about transition plans for residents and the importance of preserving affordability.

The agenda items will be revisited next week for action steps, and staff is available to answer questions or provide further clarification on any points discussed during the meeting.
