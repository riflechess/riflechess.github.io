#### Summary

The meeting began with a presentation by Evan Marron from Public Works regarding the proposed two-way conversion of Margaret Street. The presentation addressed concerns about signage and traffic flow.

The public hearing for the Robert Street Reconstruction Project was held, with several community members testifying in support of the project and expressing concerns about pedestrian safety and mitigation during construction.

Council Member Necker commended the Westside Community Organization's efforts to engage with MnDOT and the community. He noted that it is challenging to do multi-jurisdictional road reconstruction and acknowledged that some roads, like University Avenue, have been redone in recent years but could be improved upon.

Council Members Pervatsky and Jost expressed appreciation for the partnership with MnDOT and the funding received for the project. They also noted that there will be many streets like this in the future that will need to be reconstructed, especially city-owned streets.

The meeting concluded with a public hearing on the appeal of Stronger Sober House's decision by the Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA). The BZA had denied a variance request to convert a 12-resident sober house into a supportive housing facility. After reviewing testimony and staff reports, the Council President voted to deny the appeal.

The Legislative Hearing Consent Agenda items were reviewed, with no one present to testify on any specific item. After closing the public hearing, the consent agenda was adopted as amended.

In other news, Vice President Kim announced that there will be a party this Saturday at Rice Larpenter Park hosted by the Fabulous Rice and Larpenter Alliance, featuring free music, food, family activities, and more.
