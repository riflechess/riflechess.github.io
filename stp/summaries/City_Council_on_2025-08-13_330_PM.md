#### Summary
The meeting began with a brief introduction by Council President Nacre. The council approved several resolutions, including one honoring the St. Paul Downtown Improvement District Ambassadors for their dedication to safety, cleanliness, and hospitality in downtown St. Paul. The ambassadors were recognized for their hard work every day, and a resolution was adopted to acknowledge their contributions.

Next, the council appointed Kamud Verma as chief budget officer for the city council, and Tim Greenfield as the chief policy officer. Both individuals expressed gratitude for the trust placed in them and committed to working together with the council to accomplish their goals.

The council also approved several ordinances, including one establishing new classifications for legislative hearing officers and another amending the appendix to chapter 409 of the legislative code.

A public hearing was held on Item 31 regarding an interim ordinance to put a moratorium on sober houses and supportive housing facilities pending the completion of a zoning study. Several speakers testified, expressing concerns about the safety and impact of these facilities in their neighborhoods.

Regarding the Robert Street reconstruction project, several members of the public spoke about their concerns and suggestions for improving pedestrian safety and accessibility. Council Member Nacre expressed appreciation for the community's involvement in the project and encouraged continued collaboration with MnDOT and other stakeholders.

The council also discussed Item 37, an appeal from Stronger Sober House regarding a decision by the Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA) denying a variance request to establish a supportive housing facility. After hearing testimony from the appellant, the council denied the appeal based on the BZA's findings that the property owner could continue operating as a sober house without violating zoning regulations.

Finally, the council held a legislative hearing consent agenda and approved several items, including resolutions accepting grant funds for various projects and authorizing the execution of grant agreements.
