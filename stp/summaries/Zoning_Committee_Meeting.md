#### Summary

The meeting began with the approval of minutes from a previous meeting. The committee then moved on to discuss site plan reviews for two properties: an attached garage storage facility at 488-448 University Avenue West, and a compressed natural gas garbage truck filling facility and construction of bituminous pavement over an existing gravel parking lot at 560 Randolph Avenue.

The main item on the agenda was an appeal of a similar use determination for 560 Randolph Avenue. The Fort Road Federation appealed the determination that FCC Environmental Services' proposed truck dispatch and maintenance facility is similar in character and impact to a public works yard or maintenance facility. The committee heard testimony from both sides, with some community members expressing concerns about the potential impacts on the neighborhood, while others supported the project.

After hearing testimony, Commissioner Grill made a motion to move the staff recommendation to deny the appeal, which was seconded by Commissioner Saeed. The committee then engaged in discussion and debate, with some members questioning the similarity between the proposed use and a public works yard or maintenance facility. Others raised concerns about the potential impacts on traffic, noise, and air quality.

The motion to deny the appeal passed 4-1, with Chair Tagayoff voting against it. The committee's recommendation will be forwarded to the Planning Commission for consideration at their next meeting.

In other business, the committee heard testimony from community members regarding a non-conforming use permit application for a service business with a workshop at 237 Richmond Street. Some neighbors expressed concerns about the potential impacts on traffic and noise, while others supported the project.

The committee ultimately decided to lay over the item for two weeks to allow staff to draft new findings supporting a potential denial by recommendation of denial from this committee.

Finally, the committee adjourned early due to technical issues with the audio equipment.
