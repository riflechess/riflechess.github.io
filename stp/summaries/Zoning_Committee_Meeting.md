#### Summary
The Zoning Committee meeting began with a presentation by city planners regarding proposed zoning changes to allow for increased density in the Cathedral Hill and Summit neighborhoods. The plans aim to address housing shortages and encourage mixed-use developments.

Key decisions:

* **Proposal 1:** Allow up to 3-story buildings along Summit Avenue, subject to historic district guidelines.
* **Proposal 2:** Rezone Cathedral Hill area to permit more commercial activity.
* **Proposal 3:** Increase lot coverage ratio for new construction in the University neighborhood.

**Contestation:**
A heated discussion arose regarding Proposal 1, with some committee members expressing concerns about preserving the historic character of Summit Avenue. One member suggested revising the plan to limit buildings to 2 stories or less to maintain the area's aesthetic.

The committee ultimately voted on Proposal 1, with a majority (7-4) in favor of allowing up to 3-story buildings. However, several members expressed reservations about potential over-development and its impact on local businesses.

Further discussion will be held at the next meeting, where public comments and revisions to the proposals are expected.
