#### Summary
The meeting covered several topics related to zoning and development. Key points include:

* Proposed zoning change for the East Side neighborhood to allow for more mixed-use buildings: The committee voted in favor of the proposal (4-1), with Commissioner Johnson dissenting, citing concerns about increased density and parking issues.
* Update on the new light rail station development at the intersection of Summit Avenue and Dale Street: The developer presented plans for a 10-story residential building, which was met with some opposition from nearby residents concerned about noise and traffic.
* Discussion of a new bike-share program in Saint Paul: The committee expressed support for the initiative, but noted that more details were needed on funding and implementation.

The most contentious issue of the evening was the proposed zoning change for the East Side neighborhood. Commissioner Johnson argued that the increased density would lead to parking problems and strain on local infrastructure. Commissioner Thompson countered that the change would bring in much-needed revenue and stimulate economic growth. The committee ultimately voted in favor of the proposal, but with a condition that the developer must address parking concerns through additional studies.

The bike-share program received broad support from the committee, with some members expressing excitement about the potential for more sustainable transportation options in Saint Paul. However, several questions were raised about funding and implementation details, which will be explored further at future meetings.
