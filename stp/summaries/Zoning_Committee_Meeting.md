#### Summary
The meeting started with a presentation by the Nacre (Noecker) office regarding the proposed development on the corner of University Avenue and Western Street. The proposal involves building a 12-story apartment complex, which sparked some debate among committee members.

One concern raised was the potential impact on traffic in the area, given the proximity to the university. Some committee members suggested that the city should require the developers to provide more parking solutions for residents and visitors.

The main discussion point was whether the proposed building height complies with current zoning regulations. After some deliberation, the majority of the committee voted (6-3) in favor of recommending approval of the proposal. However, two Nacre (Noecker) representatives expressed concerns about the project's potential strain on local infrastructure.

The committee also reviewed several other zoning applications, including a proposal for a new restaurant in the downtown area. Most of these were approved with little discussion.

Overall, while some controversy arose during the meeting, the majority of proposed developments received approval from the Zoning Committee.
