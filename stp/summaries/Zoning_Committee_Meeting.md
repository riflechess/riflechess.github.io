#### Summary

The meeting began with the approval of the minutes from the previous meeting. The committee then reviewed two site plan reviews for new construction projects on Highland Bridge.

The first item up for discussion was a CUP application (25-004-887) for a farmers market at 1545 Hamlin Avenue in the Como neighborhood. The applicant, Lindsay Stoner from St. Paul Farmer's Market, explained that they will be bringing 20 vendors selling local food and will operate on Thursdays from mid-May to October. Commissioner Saeed asked about the operation schedule, and Stoner replied that it would be one day a week.

The committee held a public hearing, during which no opposition was raised, but some questions were asked by residents regarding parking and electromagnetic interference. The applicant addressed these concerns, stating that they will not have many employees working on-site, and their service is passive with no electromagnetic fields.

Commissioner Hood suggested creating a list of potential zoning code changes to be reviewed by the council in the future. Commissioner Starling expressed some concerns about the lot size for the farmers market but ultimately voted in favor of the CUP.

The next item discussed was a CUP application (25004-867) for a utility building at 1540 Randolph Avenue. The applicant, US Internet, explained that they will be installing a fiber internet switching station and removing some windows on the north side of the building. Commissioner Ochoa expressed concerns about the density of the use and how it may impact the neighborhood's character.

The committee held another public hearing, during which one resident expressed concerns about parking and electromagnetic interference. The applicant addressed these concerns, stating that they will not have many employees working on-site and their service is passive with no electromagnetic fields.

Commissioner Grell proposed a motion to approve the staff recommendation for the utility building CUP. Commissioner Schauer expressed some reservations but ultimately voted in favor of the motion. A friendly amendment was proposed by Commissioner Ochoa to remove one of the curb cuts, but it was not accepted by the proposers, and the original motion passed.

The meeting concluded with a vote on the motion, which carried 5-0-0.
