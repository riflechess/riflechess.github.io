#### Summary
The Zoning Committee held a public hearing on the rezoning application for 959 Payne Ave. The applicant, Matt Kennevin and Kenneth Littleton, presented their proposal to establish a cannabis processing facility in the area. Staff recommended approval of the rezoning from B2 Community Business to T2 Traditional Neighborhood, citing consistency with the comprehensive plan and surrounding zoning patterns.

Commissioner Grell raised concerns about the application being centered around the use rather than the zoning change itself. However, Chair Tagayoff clarified that the committee is evaluating the land use and zoning changes separately.

The applicant addressed concerns from the neighborhood about external effects, such as odor and noise, by stating that their processing facility would be solventless and contained within the building. They also explained that they would be using a micro-business license, which allows for multiple verticals of cannabis production.

After public testimony (or lack thereof), the committee moved to close the public hearing and discuss the application. Commissioner Stalling asked follow-up questions about the proposed use and its containment within the site.

The committee ultimately voted unanimously to recommend approval of the rezoning to T2 Traditional Neighborhood, citing consistency with the comprehensive plan and surrounding zoning patterns, as well as the regulation of cannabis use by state and city agencies.
