#### Summary
The meeting began with a review of the agenda, which included several zoning proposals for new developments in various neighborhoods. The first item up for discussion was a proposal to rezone a vacant lot on University Avenue from commercial to residential.

* **Proposal 1: Rezone Lot on University Avenue**: This proposal was met with some opposition from local business owners who argued that the change would lead to increased traffic and parking issues in the area. However, supporters of the proposal pointed out that the rezoning would allow for more affordable housing options in a densely populated neighborhood.

After some debate, the committee voted 5-3 in favor of approving the rezoning proposal.

* **Other Proposals:**
	+ Proposal to permit a new brewery on Rice Street was approved with a 6-1 vote.
	+ Proposal to rezone a strip mall on Snelling Avenue from commercial to mixed-use was tabled for further discussion due to concerns about parking and pedestrian safety.

The committee also discussed several variances, including one related to a proposed high-rise development in the Lowertown neighborhood. This proposal was met with significant opposition from neighbors who expressed concerns about increased density and potential impacts on local infrastructure.

* **Variance Proposal: High-Rise Development**: The variance proposal was ultimately tabled due to concerns about parking, noise, and traffic. While some committee members felt that the development would bring much-needed housing options to the area, others were concerned about its potential impact on the character of the neighborhood.

The meeting concluded with a discussion of future agenda items and a reminder that public comments can be submitted in writing or in person at upcoming meetings.
