#### Summary
The meeting began with a review of the minutes from the previous Zoning Committee meeting. The committee then moved on to discuss three conditional use permit applications.

**Item 1: Venue 1944 Rental Hall CUP**
The first application was for a conditional use permit for a reception hall or rental hall at 839 University Avenue West in Frogtown. After reviewing the staff report and hearing public testimony, the committee voted unanimously (3-0) to approve the staff recommendation.

**Item 2: 2284 7th Street West CUP**
The second application was for a conditional use permit for an adult care home at 2284 7th Street West in the Highland neighborhood. The committee discussed concerns about parking and accessibility, but ultimately voted (3-2) to approve the staff recommendation.

**Item 3: 1190 James Avenue CUP**
The third application was for a conditional use permit for a wellness club on the main floor of a large structure at 1190 James Avenue in the Macalester Groveland neighborhood. The committee discussed concerns about parking, noise, and infrastructure, but ultimately voted (3-2) to approve the staff recommendation.

In each case, the committee recommended approval subject to certain conditions, such as maintaining the existing character of the building and ensuring that the use does not negatively impact the surrounding neighborhood.

The meeting concluded with a brief discussion and vote on the final motion, which approved the staff recommendations for all three applications. The meeting adjourned shortly thereafter.
