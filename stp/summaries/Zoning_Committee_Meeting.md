#### Summary
The meeting began with a presentation on the proposed redevelopment plan for the Upper Landing area. The plan includes a mix of residential and commercial units, as well as a public park.

* Key decisions:
	+ Approved the redevelopment plan for the Upper Landing area, subject to further review and public input.
	+ Recommended that the City Council allocate $1 million for infrastructure improvements in the area.
	+ Established a community advisory committee to oversee the project's progress and ensure it meets community needs.

A contentious issue arose when a resident from the nearby Summit neighborhood expressed concerns about increased traffic and parking pressures. Several neighbors echoed these concerns, citing potential safety risks and decreased quality of life.

* Notable disagreement:
	+ A few committee members questioned whether the proposed zoning changes would actually alleviate traffic and parking issues, pointing to previous studies indicating that more residents in the area might exacerbate existing problems.
	+ The city planner argued that the redevelopment plan included measures to mitigate these concerns, such as increased public transportation options and improved pedestrian infrastructure.
