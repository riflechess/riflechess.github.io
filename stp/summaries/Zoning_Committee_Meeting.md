#### Summary

The Zoning Committee met to discuss several proposals and ongoing development projects. Key decisions include:

* Approved a variance for a new apartment complex in the Payne-Phalen neighborhood, allowing for an additional floor above the originally proposed height.
	+ Discussion centered around concerns about increased density and potential impact on local infrastructure. Commissioner Rodriguez expressed reservations but ultimately voted in favor.
* Denied a zoning change request for a commercial property in the Summit-University area, citing concerns over parking and pedestrian safety.
	+ The proposal was met with opposition from nearby residents who feared increased traffic and decreased quality of life.

A lengthy discussion took place regarding a proposed affordable housing development on the east side. While some committee members expressed support for the project's intention to provide much-needed affordable units, others raised concerns about potential gentrification and displacement of existing low-income residents.

The committee also discussed updates on several ongoing projects, including:

* A new community garden in the North End
* A proposal for a bike-sharing program in downtown Saint Paul

No vote was taken on these items, but they are expected to be revisited at future meetings.
