#### Summary

The meeting began with a public hearing for a CUP at 435 University Ave. Estefan Hankerson, the planner assigned to the case, presented on behalf of Union Gospel Mission Twin Cities (UGMTC). The application seeks to expand an emergency housing facility from 138 beds to 210 beds.

Commissioner Burrell asked if there were any additional modifications to the facility beyond the change in number of beds. Hankerson replied that they are only considering the expansion of the facility residents at this time.

Chair Tagiaff clarified that, if denied, UGMTC would still be able to operate the existing facility as a legal non-conforming use.

Pam Stewart-Axberg, CEO of UGMTC, spoke on behalf of the applicant. She explained that the renovation is primarily focused on upgrading the facility and providing more space for residents, including lockers, beds, and dining capacity.

The public hearing was closed, and a motion to approve the staff recommendation with modification to increase the maximum number of facility residents to 210 was made by Commissioner Saeed. The motion passed unanimously (5-0) with Commissioner Hood abstaining.

This recommendation will be sent to the Planning Commission for their consideration and action.

Note: There were no public comments or opposition to the application during the public hearing.
