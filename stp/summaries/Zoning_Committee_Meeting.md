#### Summary

The meeting began with a presentation from the city planner regarding a proposed development project in the Lowertown neighborhood. The project involves the construction of a new apartment building and a small retail space.

Key decisions:

* The committee voted to approve the zoning changes required for the project (7-0).
* A budget allocation of $50,000 was approved for the creation of a community outreach program related to the development.
* The proposal to allow for a conditional use permit for a daycare center in the building was tabled until the next meeting.

There was some discussion regarding parking and traffic concerns surrounding the project. Committee member Mark Johnson expressed concerns about the potential impact on nearby streets, but ultimately voted in favor of the proposal. Committee Chair Rachel Lee emphasized the importance of considering community input in future development projects.

The meeting also included a public comment period, during which several residents spoke out against the proposed zoning changes, citing concerns about gentrification and displacement of long-time residents.
