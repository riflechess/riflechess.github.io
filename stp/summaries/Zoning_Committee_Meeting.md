#### Summary

The meeting began with a review of the meeting minutes from the previous meeting on February 13th. The committee then moved on to discuss several items related to zoning and land use.

**Item 1: Brentag Tanker Terminal Site Plan Review**
The committee approved a layover for two weeks to allow staff to refine their findings on a non-conforming use permit application at 237 Richmond Street. This decision was made after the applicant requested a layover due to city staff needing more time to work on updated findings.

**Item 2: Childs Road CUP**
The committee voted unanimously to recommend approval of a conditional use permit (CUP) for the construction of a new barge unloading terminal at 2145 Childs Road. The applicant, Mr. Williams, presented a detailed overview of the project and explained how it meets FEMA standards for development in the floodplain.

**Item 3: Rezoning at 635 Cleveland Avenue South**
The committee voted unanimously to recommend approval of a rezoning application from OS (Office Service) to T2 (Traditional Neighborhoods) for a property located at 635 Cleveland Avenue South. The applicant, Montessori 3, plans to convert the existing building into a retail store and makerspace.

**Item 4: Rezoning at 959 Payne Avenue**
The committee laid over this item for four weeks to allow staff to prepare for a public hearing. This decision was made after the Payne Phelan Community Council requested a layover to discuss the application with District 5 residents.

**Item 5: Conditional Use Permit at 642 Selby Avenue**
The committee voted unanimously to recommend approval of a conditional use permit (CUP) to increase the maximum building height from 55 to 60 feet for a five-story mixed-use building at 642 Selby Avenue. The applicant, [name], presented a shadow study and explained how the increased height would not have significant impacts on surrounding properties.

Note: There was some discussion about the applicant's reason for requesting an additional five feet in height, but it was determined that this was relevant only to the extent that it affected the project's viability.
