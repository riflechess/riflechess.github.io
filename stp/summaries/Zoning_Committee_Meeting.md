#### Summary
The Zoning Committee meeting covered several topics:

* **Proposal to rezone a property on University Avenue**: The proposal aims to allow for mixed-use development, including residential and commercial units. Some committee members expressed concerns about potential parking issues and traffic congestion.
* **Discussion of variance requests**: A few residents spoke in favor of granting variances for homes with non-compliant additions. Committee members debated the merits of granting variances, with some arguing that it would set a precedent for future variances.
* **Update on Saint Paul's comprehensive plan**: The city planner presented an update on the comprehensive plan, highlighting initiatives to promote affordable housing and community development.

The proposal to rezone the University Avenue property was voted 5-2 in favor of approval. However, some committee members expressed reservations about the potential impact on parking and traffic. Committee member Rachel Johnson stated that while she supported the proposal, she had concerns about the lack of specific plans for addressing parking shortages.

No vote was taken on the variance requests, as it was decided to table the discussion until the next meeting.

In other news, several residents spoke in favor of designating a community garden on a vacant lot in the city's East Side. The proposal is expected to be brought before the full City Council for a vote.

The comprehensive plan update was generally well-received by committee members, who acknowledged the need for more affordable housing and community development initiatives.
