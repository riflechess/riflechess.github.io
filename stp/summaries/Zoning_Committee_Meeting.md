#### Summary

The meeting began with a discussion on the proposed rezoning of a commercial property in the Summit-University neighborhood. The proposal would rezone the property to allow for mixed-use development.

* Key points:
	+ Supporters argued that the rezoning would bring in new businesses and increase foot traffic in the area.
	+ Opponents expressed concerns about increased density, parking issues, and potential noise disturbances.
	+ The committee voted 4-1 in favor of recommending the zoning change to the City Council.

A second topic discussed was the proposed update to the city's zoning code. The update aims to simplify the code and make it more accessible for property owners.

* Key points:
	+ Committee members debated the merits of adopting a "form-based" zoning approach, which would focus on building form and character rather than strict use regulations.
	+ Some committee members expressed concerns that the new approach would be too restrictive or open to interpretation.

The meeting concluded with no votes taken on budget allocations or tax proposals.
