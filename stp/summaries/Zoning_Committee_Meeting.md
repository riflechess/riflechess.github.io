#### Summary
The meeting began with a discussion on the approval of minutes from the previous meeting. The next item was a presentation by Valerie Quarles, a senior city planner, regarding a conditional use permit for a farmer's market at the corner of Rice and Larpenter streets. After some questions and discussion, the committee voted to approve the application.

The next item was a presentation by Ms. Hong regarding a conditional use permit for an event hall, short-term rental units, a Montessori school, and daycare at 325 Dayton Avenue. The applicant, Tom Struvi and Mohamed Suedan, presented their case, addressing concerns about parking and highlighting the benefits of the proposal.

After some discussion, the committee voted to approve the application with conditions related to parking and transportation.

The final item was a rezoning application for the Ham's Brewery site. Director Nicole Newton from the Housing and Redevelopment Authority presented the proposal, which included mixed-use development, commercial space, and preservation of historic buildings. The proposal was met with some opposition from Commissioner Hood, who raised concerns about spot zoning and compatibility of use.

After further discussion, the committee voted to table the motion until more information could be provided. However, later in the meeting, Commissioner Grill made a new motion to approve the rezoning of parcels one and two from I-2 to RM2, which passed unanimously. The meeting concluded with a vote on the rezoning of parcel five from I-2 to H-2, which also passed.

The meeting was adjourned after some praise for the new format of the packet provided by staff.
