#### Summary

The meeting covered three main agenda items:

* Proposal for a new high-rise development in the Downtown East area:
	+ The developer is seeking a zoning variance to build a 30-story building with 400 units.
	+ The committee discussed concerns about density, parking, and potential impact on neighborhood character.
* Appeal of a denied variance for a single-family home renovation in the Summit-University area:
	+ The homeowner argued that the renovation would not significantly alter the property's appearance or create undue hardship.
	+ Committee members expressed concern about precedent-setting and potential effects on neighboring properties.
* Discussion on revising the city's zoning code to allow for more flexible mixed-use development:
	+ Proponents argued that this would help revitalize underutilized commercial spaces and promote economic growth.
	+ Opponents raised concerns about overdevelopment, gentrification, and potential negative impacts on community character.

The committee voted 4-2 in favor of recommending approval for the high-rise development proposal. The dissenting members expressed concerns about density and lack of community input.
