#### Summary

The Zoning Committee Meeting covered several key topics, including:

* **Proposal for a new high-rise development**: The committee voted 5-2 in favor of approving a proposal for a new high-rise development in the downtown area. The project includes plans for 300 residential units, commercial space, and parking garage.
	+ Supporters argued that the project would bring much-needed housing and economic growth to the city.
	+ Opponents expressed concerns about increased traffic congestion, noise pollution, and strain on local infrastructure.
* **Zoning code amendment**: The committee voted unanimously (7-0) to amend the zoning code to allow for smaller lot sizes in certain neighborhoods. This change aims to increase density and affordability in these areas.
* **Community input**: Several residents spoke out against a proposed zoning change that would allow for a large warehouse facility in their neighborhood. They expressed concerns about noise, pollution, and property values.

The meeting was generally cordial, with most attendees respectful of differing opinions. However, the high-rise development proposal sparked some heated debate, with opponents claiming that it would "destroy the character" of the neighborhood. The committee chair intervened to ensure that all voices were heard and allowed time for rebuttals from both sides.
