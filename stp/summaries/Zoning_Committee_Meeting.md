#### Summary
The Zoning Committee meeting began with a discussion on the approval of minutes from the June 26, 2025 meeting. The committee then moved on to new business and considered three items: Interfaith Action's request for a CUP for an emergency housing facility at 1010 Bandana Boulevard, a reestablishment non-conforming use permit for a general store at 469 Anita Street, and a CUP for a shelter for battered persons at 362 Cleveland Ave North.

**Interfaith Action's Request:** The committee discussed Interfaith Action's proposal to convert the former Best Western Hotel into an emergency housing facility. Staff recommended approval of the CUP with modification to allow more than 16 residents. After some discussion, Commissioner Ochoa suggested that the motion be modified to specify the intent behind modifying the special condition. The committee ultimately voted in favor of the motion as written, with the understanding that the language could be clarified at a later date.

**Reestablishment Non-Conforming Use Permit:** The committee considered an application for a reestablishment non-conforming use permit for a general store at 469 Anita Street. Staff recommended approval subject to conditions, including final plans approved by the zoning administrator and business hours limited to conclude at 10 p.m. The motion passed with no opposition.

**Shelter for Battered Persons:** The committee discussed an application for a CUP for a shelter for battered persons at 362 Cleveland Ave North. Staff recommended approval subject to conditions, including final plans approved by the zoning administrator. Commissioner Hurd raised questions about a change in state law regarding supportive housing facilities and how it relates to this application. After some discussion, Commissioner Grill moved to adopt the staff recommendation with modification of the minimum distance requirement from supportive housing facilities with more than six adult residents. The motion passed with no opposition.

Overall, the committee voted in favor of both applications, with some modifications to the language of one of the motions.
