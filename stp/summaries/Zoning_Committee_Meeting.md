#### Meeting Info
**Zoning Committee Meeting**
**Date:** February 22, 2023
**Time:** 6:00 PM
**Location:** City Hall, Room 300
**Attendees:** Members of the Zoning Committee, City Council Members, and Public Participants

#### Summary

The main topics discussed during the meeting were:

* **Proposal for a new high-rise development in Downtown Saint Paul**: The committee reviewed plans for a proposed 20-story building on 4th Street. After some discussion, they voted to recommend approval of the project, citing its potential economic benefits and alignment with city planning goals.

Some members expressed concerns about parking and traffic congestion, but these issues were deemed manageable by the developers. Notably, Council Member Jane Smith opposed the proposal due to concerns about preserving historic buildings in the area. However, her vote was not enough to sway the majority, which voted 6-3 in favor of recommending approval.

* **Update on Small Business Zoning Regulations**: The committee reviewed proposed changes to zoning regulations affecting small businesses. After some debate, they voted to approve modifications that aim to support local entrepreneurs and reduce bureaucratic hurdles.
* **Public Comments**: Several residents spoke about concerns regarding noise pollution from the increased development in the city. Committee members acknowledged these issues and promised to consider implementing measures to mitigate the effects.

The committee also briefly discussed plans for upcoming community events and announced a public hearing scheduled for next month to gather feedback on proposed zoning changes related to affordable housing.

A notable point of contention arose when Council Member Smith strongly advocated for more robust measures to address noise pollution, but was met with resistance from some developers who argued that such regulations would stifle economic growth. The debate highlights the ongoing challenge in balancing development and community needs.
