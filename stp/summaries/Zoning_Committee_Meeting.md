#### Meeting Info
**Meeting Type:** Zoning Committee Meeting
**Purpose:** Review and discussion of zoning proposals and amendments for the City of Saint Paul
**Date/Time:** Wednesday, March 15, 2023, 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM
**Location:** City Hall, Room 317

#### Summary
The meeting began with a presentation by city planners on several proposed zoning changes in the Highland Park neighborhood. These proposals aim to revitalize underutilized commercial areas and promote mixed-use development.

Key discussion points:

* **Zoning Code Amendment**: The committee reviewed and discussed a proposal to modify the city's zoning code to allow for taller buildings in certain neighborhoods.
* **Highland Park Development Project**: A developer presented plans for a new mixed-use building on Snelling Avenue, which would include residential units, retail space, and parking. Committee members raised concerns about traffic congestion and pedestrian safety.
* **Public Hearing on Zoning Variance**: The committee held a public hearing to consider a zoning variance request for a property on Selby Avenue. Neighbors expressed opposition due to potential noise and disruption from the proposed new business.

A contentious moment arose when committee member Councilor Jeanine DeLay expressed concerns about the Highland Park Development Project, citing fears of over-development and strain on local infrastructure. She was joined by other committee members who shared similar sentiments. The developer responded with assurances that their project would be designed to minimize impact on the community.

The committee ultimately voted in favor of moving forward with the zoning code amendment, but the proposal for the Highland Park Development Project was tabled until further review.

Action items:

* The city planners will refine the zoning code amendment and present revised language for future consideration.
* The Highland Park Development Project will undergo additional scrutiny, including a site visit by the committee to assess potential impacts on traffic and pedestrian safety.
* The public hearing on the zoning variance request was continued to allow for further discussion with neighbors and property owners.
