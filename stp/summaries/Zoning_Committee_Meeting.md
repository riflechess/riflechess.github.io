#### Summary

The meeting began with the approval of the minutes from the February 27th, 2025, Zoning Committee Meeting. The committee then moved on to discuss two site plan reviews: the United Village Interim Parking Lot and the YMCA Child Care Centre.

However, the majority of the meeting focused on the 237 Richmond non-conforming use permit. Commissioner Hankerson presented two options for consideration: an updated staff report with additional conditions to address concerns raised at a previous public hearing, and alternative findings that would support denial.

The committee discussed various questions regarding the conditions, including enforcement procedures and the process for ensuring compliance. They also debated the appropriateness of the new business use in the area, citing concerns about compatibility with the comprehensive plan standards.

Commissioner Grill proposed a motion to recommend approval of the non-conforming use permit with the updated conditions. The motion was seconded and passed with three votes in favor and two opposed (including Commissioner Hood's "no" vote).

The committee concluded their discussion on this item, recommending approval to the full planning commission at their next meeting.
