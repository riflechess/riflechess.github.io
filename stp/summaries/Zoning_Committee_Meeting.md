#### Summary

The Zoning Committee meeting covered several key topics:

* **Proposal for Mixed-Use Development on Grand Avenue**: The committee reviewed a proposal to redevelop a site on Grand Avenue with a mix of residential units and commercial space. After discussion, the committee voted 5-2 in favor of recommending approval of the plan, pending further review by the Planning Commission.
* **Height Variance Request for High-Rise Development**: A developer requested a height variance for a proposed high-rise building in the Lowertown neighborhood. The committee debated the merits of granting the variance, with some members expressing concerns about potential impacts on nearby residents and businesses. Ultimately, the committee voted 4-3 against recommending approval of the variance.
* **Zoning Code Update**: The committee discussed proposed changes to the city's zoning code, including updates to parking requirements and setbacks for certain types of buildings. After some discussion, the committee voted unanimously in favor of sending the proposals to the Planning Commission for further review.

The most contentious issue of the evening was the height variance request, with several members expressing strong opinions on both sides of the debate. One member argued that granting the variance would be a "slippery slope" and would set a precedent for future developments, while another member countered that the developer had made concessions to mitigate potential impacts and that denying the variance would be unfair.
