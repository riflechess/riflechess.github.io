#### Summary
The meeting focused on proposed zoning changes in the Cathedral Hill neighborhood. The main topic of discussion was a request to rezone several parcels of land to allow for higher-density development.

Key points:

* The proposed rezoning would enable developers to build larger apartments and condos.
* Opponents argued that this would lead to increased traffic and strain on local infrastructure.
* Proponents claimed that the changes would bring in more tax revenue and create new housing options.

There was significant contention regarding a specific proposal for a 12-story building at the corner of Selby Avenue and Cretin Avenue. Some committee members expressed concerns about its height, while others saw it as a necessary step to revitalize the area.

The committee ultimately voted to table the proposal until further study could be conducted on its potential impact.

* Voting results:
	+ 4 committee members in favor of tabling
	+ 2 opposed to tabling
	+ 1 abstained
