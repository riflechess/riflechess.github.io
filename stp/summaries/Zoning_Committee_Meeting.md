#### Summary
The Zoning Committee meeting covered several topics:

* **Proposal for Rezoning on University Avenue**: The committee discussed a proposal to rezone a commercial property on University Avenue. After some debate, the proposal was approved with a 7-2 vote.
	+ Concerns raised by opponents included potential gentrification and increased traffic congestion in the area.
	+ Supporters argued that the rezoning would attract new businesses and improve the overall aesthetic of the neighborhood.
* **New Zoning Regulations for Large Developments**: The committee reviewed proposed zoning regulations aimed at guiding large-scale development projects. A motion to approve the regulations was introduced but tabled until the next meeting due to some members' concerns about the scope and potential impact on local communities.
	+ Some committee members felt that the regulations did not adequately address issues related to displacement of long-time residents and lack of affordable housing options.
