#### Summary
The Zoning Committee Meeting covered several key topics:

* **New Development Proposal**: A proposal for a mixed-use development on the corner of University Avenue and Selby Street was discussed. The committee voted to approve the proposal with some modifications, including increased green space and affordable housing units.
	+ Proponents argued that the development would bring much-needed density and vitality to the area, while opponents expressed concerns about traffic and parking.
* **Zoning Code Update**: The committee reviewed proposed updates to the zoning code, aimed at streamlining the process for small businesses and startups. Members voted unanimously in favor of the update.
* **Public Safety Concerns**: A resident from the Frogtown neighborhood spoke about ongoing issues with noise and loitering near a new bar on 7th Street E. The committee acknowledged the concerns and agreed to work with local business owners and residents to find solutions.

A contentious moment arose during discussion of the new development proposal, where some members argued that the development would displace long-time businesses and residents. Others countered that it would bring much-needed investment and jobs to the area. After hearing from both sides, the committee ultimately voted 5-2 in favor of approving the modified proposal.
