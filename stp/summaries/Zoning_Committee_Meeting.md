#### Meeting Info
**Meeting Type**: Zoning Committee Meeting
**Purpose**: Review of proposed zoning changes and new developments in the city
**Date/Time**: Wednesday, March 15th, 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM
**Location**: City Hall, Room 300, Saint Paul

#### Summary
The meeting covered several proposals for zoning changes across the city. Key decisions were made on the following items:

* **Proposed Zoning Change in Frogtown**: The committee voted to approve a rezoning request to allow for a new mixed-use development at the intersection of University Avenue and 5th Street NE. The proposal aims to create more affordable housing units, retail space, and parking facilities.
* **New Development on Summit Avenue**: A developer presented plans for a new apartment complex along Summit Avenue between Selby Avenue and Western Avenue. The committee discussed concerns about traffic, noise, and potential impact on the historic neighborhood character.

A notable point of contention was the proposal to rezone a property in the Mac-Groveland neighborhood, which has been met with opposition from local residents due to concerns about increased density and potential over-development. The vote on this item was 4-3 in favor of approving the rezoning request. Some committee members expressed concerns that the proposed zoning change could lead to gentrification and displacement of existing community members.

The next Zoning Committee Meeting is scheduled for April 12th, where further discussions and votes will take place regarding these proposals.
