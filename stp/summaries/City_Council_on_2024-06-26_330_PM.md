#### Summary

The meeting began with the adoption of the consent agenda, which included several resolutions and amendments. One notable resolution was the approval of adverse action against an auto repair garage license for Mobile America Service Center due to concerns about noise and other issues.

Next, the council discussed the proposed special assessment policies, which aim to guide how the city assesses properties for public improvement projects like street reconstruction and mill and overlay work. The proposed policies build upon the current St. Paul Streets Assessment Policies from 2018 but differ in several ways, including defining terms such as project cost, city cost, and accessible cost.

The council also celebrated Black Music Month by recognizing local artists and musicians who have contributed to the legacy of black music in Saint Paul. Councilwoman Anika Bowie introduced the resolution and highlighted the significance of acknowledging black music's contributions to the community.

Additionally, the council honored Jit Bhatia for his remarkable 50 years of entrepreneurship, civic leadership, and success in the Twin Cities. Bhatia shared stories about his journey and thanked the city council for their support.

The meeting also discussed several public hearings related to zoning and land use regulations, including a proposal to amend Chapter 67 of the Legislative Code pertaining to the East Grand Avenue Overlay District. The proposed amendments aim to remove strict limitations on building size and height while maintaining pedestrian-oriented design standards.

Furthermore, the council considered resolutions related to public works projects, including a final order for mill and overlay programs and a resolution authorizing the Department of Parks and Recreation to accept grant funding for tree canopy management.

In one notable moment, a community member expressed concern about being assessed $1,500 for street maintenance work despite paying an additional 1% sales tax for street improvements. Council members provided clarification on how assessments are calculated and assured that no neighborhood would receive free work done.

Lastly, the meeting concluded with the adoption of several resolutions related to sound level variances for events at various locations in Saint Paul.
