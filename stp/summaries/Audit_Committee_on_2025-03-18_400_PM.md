#### Summary

The meeting began with an update on the community advisor vacancy. Nia proposed two dates for interviewing potential candidates: April 22nd or May, depending on the number of applicants. The committee agreed to interview on April 15th at their next audit committee meeting, and Nia will send out links to postings for the position.

The application form was also discussed. Mr. Frensworth suggested adding a ward selector to make it easier to see which ward an applicant represents. The committee debated questions 10 and 11, with some members suggesting they are not clear or may lead to biased answers. Chair Nacre proposed leaving the questions as is but incorporating interview questions to get at specific details.

The community engagement update report was also presented, highlighting efforts to meet with district councils and engage in community outreach. The committee discussed inviting district councils to attend their May meeting when the final CIB report is presented.

In the topic selection discussion, the mayor's office suggested studying compliance with the data practices act and improving the process for responding to requests. The committee also discussed other potential topics, including a staff salary study, police overtime, and examining district council activities.

The meeting concluded with a plan to compile all ideas from surveys, council discussions, and previous meetings into one document for review in the next meeting.
