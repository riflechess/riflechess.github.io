#### Meeting Info
**Meeting Type:** City Council Meeting
**Date/Time:** February 14th, 2024, 3:30 PM
**Location:** Capitol Regional Watershed District, 595 Aldine St
**Purpose:** Public Hearing on creating the Creative Enterprise Zone Commercial Development Districts and other agenda items

#### Summary

The meeting started with a brief acknowledgement from Council President Jalali for constituents in attendance. He clarified that while they appreciate the interest and comments on Palestine and Gaza, their primary focus is on addressing the City's usual business.

**Item 1: Reconsideration of Ordinance 24-7**
Council member Johnson moved to reconsider item 1, which was a motion from council member Nacre to move version 2 of the ordinance. This revised version corrected the boundaries of the map as required by the charter and legislative code. The motion passed with seven votes in favor.

**Consent Agenda Items**
The consent agenda items were reviewed, and Council Member Joseph pulled item 22 for separate discussion. The balance of the consent agenda was moved forward, passing with six votes in favor. Item 22, Resolution 24-240, authorized expenditures for food and refreshments at City events and passed after an amendment to add $500 from the City Attorney's Office.

**Public Hearing on Sound Level Variance**
A public hearing was held for item 25, which involved a sound level variance for the St. Paul Saints Baseball Club at CHS Field. The public hearing closed with six votes in favor of approving the application.

**Legislative Hearing Consent Agenda Items**
Council Member Jalali noted that someone might be present to speak on item number 37, RLH VO24-4, an appeal regarding a correction notice complaint inspection and condemnation. However, Mr. Mehta was not present, and Council Member Nacre suggested denying the appeal but providing a path for the applicant to use the space under certain conditions.

**Motion to Referral**
A motion was made by Ms. Moorman to refer the matter to the legislative hearing officer in three months to review an abatement plan. This would allow the applicant to find a suitable use for the space and potentially lift the condemnation. The motion passed with seven votes in favor.

The meeting concluded with the consent agenda adopted as amended, public hearings closed, and the resolution adopted regarding the sound level variance.

#### Highlights

*   **Creative Enterprise Zone Commercial Development Districts:** The council reconsidered Ordinance 24-7 to create four distinct commercial development districts within the creative enterprise zone. The motion passed after correcting the boundaries of the map.
*   **Food and Refreshments at City Events:** Resolution 24-240 authorized expenditures for food and refreshments at City events, including a Black History Month final event. An amendment added $500 from the City Attorney's Office to provide additional support.
*   **Sound Level Variance for St. Paul Saints Baseball Club:** A public hearing was held regarding a sound level variance for the St. Paul Saints Baseball Club at CHS Field. The application was approved with six votes in favor.

**Disagreement or Contention**

The only notable disagreement occurred during the discussion on item 37, RLH VO24-4. While Council Member Nacre initially expressed preference for allowing the applicant to speak in person, she later suggested denying the appeal and referring the matter to the legislative hearing officer in three months to review an abatement plan.
