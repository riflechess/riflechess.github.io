#### Meeting Info

* **Type:** Minneapolis Area Council of Police (MACPD) meeting
* **Purpose:** Regular public safety discussion and updates
* **Date/Time:** February [insert date] 2026, at West Minnehaha Rec Center
* **Location:** West Minnehaha Recreation Center, Saint Paul, MN

#### Summary

The Minneapolis Area Council of Police (MACPD) met at the West Minnehaha Rec Center to discuss various public safety concerns. The main agenda items were:

* **Crime Stats Update**: The police department reported a slight decrease in overall crime rates for January compared to the same period last year.
* **Neighborhood Policing Initiative**: Discussion centered on the effectiveness of community policing and strategies to build trust between law enforcement and the community.
* **Budget Allocation**: A proposal was made to allocate additional funding for community outreach programs, which includes hiring more liaison officers. The budget allocation requires approval from the Saint Paul City Council.

A point of contention arose during the discussion on the Neighborhood Policing Initiative. Commissioner Johnson expressed concerns about the lack of representation from certain neighborhoods in the initiative's planning process. He argued that this oversight may lead to a one-size-fits-all approach, neglecting the unique needs of each community.

The proposal for additional budget allocation passed with a vote of 8-2. Commissioners Johnson and Thompson voted against the measure, citing concerns about diverting funds from essential police services.

No further contentious issues arose during the meeting. The MACPD will continue to discuss public safety matters at their next scheduled meeting in March.
