**Location:** West Minnehaha Recreation Center

#### Summary
The MACPD meeting focused on addressing property maintenance and public safety issues in the West Minnehaha neighborhood. The following key points were discussed:

* **Vacant House Issue**: A vacant house at 123 Main St has been a concern for neighbors due to overgrown grass, broken windows, and potential squatting. City officials promised to follow up with the owner and send a notice.
* **Noise Complaints**: Residents reported frequent noise complaints from nearby bars and clubs, particularly on weekends. The committee suggested increasing police presence in the area during peak hours.
* **Property Code Enforcement**: The city discussed implementing more stringent property code enforcement measures, including increased fines for repeat offenders.
* **Public Safety Initiatives**: The MACPD voted to allocate $10,000 from the city's public safety budget to support a community-based crime prevention program.

There was some disagreement among committee members regarding the allocation of funds. Some argued that the $10,000 should be used for more immediate needs, such as cleaning up vacant lots or increasing street lighting. Others believed that investing in community-based programs would lead to long-term benefits and cost savings. The vote passed 6-3 in favor of allocating the funds for public safety initiatives.

Attendees also raised concerns about the lack of communication between city officials and residents regarding property maintenance issues. The MACPD agreed to schedule regular town hall meetings with affected neighbors to improve transparency and address concerns.
