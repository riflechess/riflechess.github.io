#### Summary

There were several topics discussed during the meeting:

* **Crime Prevention**: The committee discussed a proposal to create a neighborhood watch program in the area around the recreation center. A subcommittee was formed to develop plans for implementation.
* **Community Outreach**: The community outreach coordinator presented on upcoming events and initiatives, including a summer festival and youth programming.

A notable point of contention arose when discussing the proposed allocation of funds from the city's safety budget. Councilor Johnson expressed concerns that the current allocation prioritizes police presence over community programs. Councilor Rodriguez argued that this approach is effective in reducing crime rates.

The committee also discussed the potential for increasing street lighting around the recreation center to improve public safety. While there was general agreement on the need for improved lighting, some members questioned the cost and feasibility of implementing such a project.
