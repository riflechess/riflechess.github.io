#### Summary
The Planning Commission meeting focused on several key items, including:

* A proposal for a new mixed-use development in the Frogtown neighborhood, which received approval with some modifications.
* The commission discussed and approved a plan to revitalize the Payne Avenue corridor, including improvements to sidewalks, lighting, and landscaping.
* A representative from the City's Department of Public Works presented an update on the planned reconstruction of University Avenue.

Notably, there was some disagreement among commissioners regarding the proposed development in Frogtown. Commissioner Rodriguez expressed concerns about the potential impact on nearby residents and small businesses, while Commissioner Lee argued that the project would bring much-needed density and investment to the area. The proposal ultimately passed with a 6-2 vote, with Commissioners Rodriguez and Lee dissenting.

The commission also voted unanimously to allocate $200,000 in budget funds for a community engagement initiative aimed at improving public spaces and promoting community events across the city.
