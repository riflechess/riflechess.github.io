#### Summary

The meeting began with a presentation by Michael Nika Anders on the legacy of Black Minnesotans and genealogy research. He discussed how many people think African Americans came to Minnesota during the Great Migration, but in reality, they have been present since at least the 1820s. Anders also highlighted the importance of understanding the history of Black Minnesotans, including their struggles for civil rights and their contributions to the state.

Next, Shakur Ervin presented on the African-American Redress Method, specifically discussing harm reports. Ervin explained that a harms report is an impact study that documents past and current harms against African Americans in a particular municipality or community. He provided examples of successful harms reports from cities like Evanston, Illinois, and Kansas City, Missouri.

The meeting then turned to the work group updates. Jamila discussed the archival work group's progress, including setting regular meeting dates and times, enlisting note-taking software, and making contact with a community member who volunteered at the St. Paul Public Library and Hallie Q Brown Center. 

Commissioner Robinson reported on the listening committee's progress, stating that they are narrowing in on meeting in May and will only have three meetings. They plan to focus on areas with high concentrations of their communities.

Commissioner English introduced a resolution to acknowledge the cross-burning incident at a St. Paul family's home in 1990 and to set up an anti-black hate crime ordinance. He explained that there was no justice for the family, and he wants the commission to recommend a policy to address this issue.

Commissioners discussed the budget for the work plan and how it should be allocated among various projects, including the harm report and listening sessions. Some commissioners expressed concerns about making recommendations without having all the necessary information and data to support their proposals.

The meeting ended with a discussion on proposed changes to the bylaws, specifically regarding absenteeism and resignation requests. Commissioner Golden made a motion to amend the amendment section five in absentee meetings that three consecutive non-response requests for resignations will result in automatic termination and replacement.

Lastly, the commission discussed potential candidates for two open vacancies on the commission. A letter was sent out to 32 previous applicants, with 21 responding and expressing interest in being considered for the positions.
