**Location:** Highland Park Community Center, 1978 Ford Parkway, Saint Paul, MN 55116

#### Summary
The LSAC meeting covered several topics, including:

* **Budget Allocations:** The committee allocated $10,000 for the upcoming SummerFest event in Highland Park and $5,000 for the renovation of the community center's park.
* **Public Safety:** A resident expressed concerns about recent break-ins in the neighborhood. The police department promised to increase patrols in the area.
* **Quality of Life:** The committee discussed a proposal to install additional streetlights on Ford Parkway to improve visibility and safety.

However, there was some disagreement among committee members regarding the allocation of funds for SummerFest. Some members felt that $10,000 was too much for a single event, while others argued that it would be a great opportunity to bring the community together. The final vote was 5-3 in favor of allocating the funds.

Additionally, a local business owner spoke about the need for more parking spaces near the community center during events. The committee agreed to look into possible solutions.

No other contentious issues were discussed during the meeting.
