#### Summary

The meeting began with the consideration of the consent agenda, which included 20 items. After approving the consent agenda, the council moved on to discuss individual items.

One notable topic was the vacant building fee assessment for property at 759 Charles Avenue. The owner, Cook Lee, appealed for a waiver due to being out of the country when the fees were assessed and not having control over them. However, the legislative hearing officer recommended reducing the assessment by $654 to $1,964.

Another significant topic was the vacant building fee assessment for property at 120 Lighten Place. The owner, Michael O'Neill, presented a case where his client had made an agreement to purchase the property but was unable to obtain city approval before completing repairs. The council decided to lay over the matter until April 16th.

The public hearing on item 46, ratifying the appealed special tax assessment for property at 1141 University Avenue West, was also discussed. The owner, Chinedu Azarike, expressed concerns about being unaware of the building's inclusion in the vacant building program and not having a clear understanding of how to navigate the process.

The council voted to lay over several items, including item 46, until April 16th or September 10th. The public hearing on these items will continue at the next meeting.

Additionally, the council discussed and voted on creating a public safety committee. Council Member Bowie presented an amended version of the resolution, which was passed with some discussion about its scope and purpose.

The meeting also included a staff report from Director Angie Wiese regarding an ordinance amendment to regulate business licensing more efficiently. The proposed amendment aims to clarify the process for canceling licenses when businesses are delinquent in providing required materials.

Furthermore, the council held public hearings on several items related to rent stabilization and tenant protections. Many speakers expressed support or opposition to exempting new residential buildings from rent control. Some speakers argued that rent control stifles development, while others believed it is necessary for protecting tenants.

The council also discussed an ordinance creating chapter 193 of the legislative code pertaining to tenant protections. Director Wiese presented a comprehensive staff report on the proposed ordinance, which includes provisions related to security deposits, prepaid rent, applicant screening, written notice for non-payment, relocation assistance, and complaint processes.

The public hearing on the tenant protections ordinance was continued until May 7th, with many speakers expressing support or opposition to various aspects of the proposal.
