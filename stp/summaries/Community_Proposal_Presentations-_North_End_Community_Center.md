* **Location**: North End Community Center
* **Date/Time**: [Insert Date and Time]
* **Purpose**: Review and discuss proposals for community development projects in the North End area


#### Summary
Three proposals were presented to the community:

1.  North End Park Renovation: A proposal to renovate the existing park, including new playground equipment, benches, and landscaping.
2.  Community Garden Development: A plan to create a community garden on a vacant lot, providing plots for residents to grow their own fruits and vegetables.
3.  Street Art Initiative: A proposal to paint murals and other street art in the North End area, aimed at beautifying the neighborhood.

The proposals were met with enthusiasm from the audience, with many residents expressing support for all three projects. However, some concerns were raised regarding the potential impact on parking and traffic in the area.

A vote was taken on which project to move forward first, and the majority of attendees voted in favor of the Community Garden Development proposal. The other two proposals will be revisited at a future meeting.

No significant disagreement or contention arose during the discussion.
