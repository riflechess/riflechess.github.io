#### Summary

The first meeting of the Public Safety Committee was held on June 25, 2025. The committee's purpose is to ensure that public safety is a continuous conversation and dialogue among council members. The meeting focused on awareness for National Gun Violence Awareness Month, presented by the Office of Neighborhood Safety. Several community partners were invited to share their work in reducing gun violence and promoting public safety.

The second item on the agenda was staff report 25-114, Safe Summer Nights Events. Commander McCabe from the St. Paul Police Department discussed the history and evolution of Safe Summer Nights, which began as a breakfast meeting between Chief Todd Axtell and private citizen Tom Campion. The event has grown to include community services, resource tables, and educational activities.

The next agenda item was recruitment and retention in the fire department. Assistant Chief Jeremiah Milquist presented on the importance of recruitment and training in maintaining public safety readiness and workforce planning. He discussed the department's efforts to improve diversity and inclusion, including partnerships with affinity groups such as TCF3 (Twin Cities Female Firefighter Fitness Group) and Los Bomberos.

Council Member Nacre asked about the funding for Safe Summer Nights, which is a combination of private funds through the St. Paul Police Foundation and department operations funds. Commander McCabe mentioned that it's a significant investment, but didn't provide an exact number.

The meeting concluded with a discussion on overtime hours committed to firefighters using overtime to conduct training, which Assistant Chief Milquist agreed to follow up on. The next Public Safety Committee meeting is scheduled for July 23rd to discuss chemical dependency and partnerships across the board.
