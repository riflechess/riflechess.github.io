#### Meeting Info
* Type: City Council Meeting
* Purpose: Public discussion and decision-making for the city of Saint Paul
* Date/Time: 2024-09-11, 3:30 PM

#### Summary
The meeting began with a series of awkward pauses and mis-translations. After some initial confusion, the council members got down to business.

One of the main topics discussed was the proposed budget for 2025. The current draft allocates $10 million towards infrastructure improvements, which includes repairing and upgrading several bridges across the city. Council member Nacre (corrected from "Nacre") expressed concerns that this amount may not be sufficient, given the growing needs in various wards.

The council also discussed the ongoing issue of public safety. There was a heated debate about whether to increase funding for the police department or redirect it towards community programs and social services. Council member Johnson argued that more policing is needed to combat rising crime rates, while others, like Councilor Nacre (again), countered that this approach has not shown promising results in other cities.

A proposal to establish a new green space in the city's west end was also brought up for discussion. While some members were enthusiastic about the idea, others raised concerns about the cost and potential impact on nearby residents.

The meeting concluded with a vote on several resolutions, including one that passed unanimously regarding support for local businesses affected by recent construction projects.
