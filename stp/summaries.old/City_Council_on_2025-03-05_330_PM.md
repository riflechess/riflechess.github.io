#### Summary

The meeting began with the adoption of the consent agenda, which included items such as staff reports and routine business. The city attorney, Lindsay Olson, administered oaths to assistant city attorneys.

Next, the council discussed several zoning appeals, including ABZA 25-1 and 25-2, which involved a mixed-use development on Ford Parkway. Due to lack of votes, these items were withdrawn per Minnesota statute.

The council then moved on to discuss ordinances related to water rates (Ordinance 25-6), water service connections (Ordinance 25-7), and fire supplies (Ordinance 25-9). Public hearings were held for each ordinance, but no one testified in opposition or in favor. The ordinances were laid over until March 12th.

A public hearing was also held on the appeal of the University of St. Thomas regarding a conditional use permit condition that requires the removal of a driveway from Goodrich Avenue. Testifiers included representatives from the university, neighbors, and students. The majority of testifiers supported the appeal to modify the conditional use permit to allow for emergency access.

The council also discussed several resolutions related to budget amendments, grant funding, and community engagement efforts.
