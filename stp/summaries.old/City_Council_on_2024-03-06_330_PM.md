#### Summary
The City Council meeting on March 6, 2024, was a significant gathering that addressed several crucial topics. The meeting began with the adoption of the consent agenda items 5 through 21 without any opposition.

One of the major discussion points was Resolution 24386, calling for an immediate and permanent mutual ceasefire in Israel and Gaza. Council Member Johnson introduced the resolution, citing concerns about the humanitarian situation and the need for international action to prevent further violence. Several council members spoke in support of the resolution, highlighting its importance in promoting peace and unity.

Council Member Kim expressed her gratitude for the council's effort but noted that she had reservations about not including the historical context of the ongoing bombardment in Gaza, which has been an issue for 75 years.
