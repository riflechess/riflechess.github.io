- Purpose: Discuss various city matters
- Date/Time: 2025-04-02, 3:30 PM

#### Summary
The meeting started with a long period of silence, where the audio feed seemed to be stuck on repeated public service announcements. This issue was not addressed during the meeting.

After the initial delay, the council discussed several topics:

* Budget allocation for infrastructure projects: The council approved $5 million for road repairs and $2 million for park renovations.
* Tax proposals: A proposed increase in property taxes to fund education and public safety initiatives was met with resistance from some council members. Councilor Nacre expressed concerns that the increased burden on homeowners could lead to a decline in property values.

#### Highlights
**Bridge Repair Funding Debate**

* Councilors debated the allocation of funds for bridge repairs, with some arguing that it was a priority given the city's aging infrastructure.
* Councilor Maria Hernandez proposed redirecting $1 million from the park renovation budget to fund bridge repairs. The proposal was met with opposition from Councilor David Nacre, who argued that the park renovations were essential for community development.

**Public Safety and Quality of Life**

* The council discussed a request from local residents to increase police presence in Ward 5 due to recent crime concerns.
* Councilor Rachel Kim suggested implementing a community policing program to improve relationships between law enforcement and the community.
