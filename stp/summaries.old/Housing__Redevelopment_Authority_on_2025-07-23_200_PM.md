She noted that 18 corridors were identified for the program, with a mix of district councils and community-based organizations selected to administer the funds. The presentation highlighted the distribution of funding among different eligible uses, such as marketing and promotions, beautification efforts, business support sub-grants, and public art projects.

Commissioners expressed appreciation for the program and its impact on their respective wards. Commissioner Bravatsky mentioned that the upfront disbursement was a game-changer, allowing organizations to start making progress immediately. The meeting concluded with a vote to approve the update, with no opposition.

The second item discussed HRA-owned land development updates. Principal Project Manager Daniela Lorenz presented the plan to dispose of or sell remaining NSP properties due to HUD deadlines. She highlighted several projects in various stages of completion, including 560 Brunson, 930 York, and 729 Burr. The meeting concluded with a discussion on the role of the economic development team in facilitating more development on HRA-owned land.

The final item concerned an update on supportive housing budget allocation. Vice Chair Jost presented the context for the $880,000 allocated to supportive housing RFP, which was part of the 2025 budget process. Commissioner Kim expressed support for shifting funds towards emergency shelter operations and prevention services, citing a growing need in her ward. The meeting concluded with a discussion on verifying that any proposed allocation change would be an eligible use under Laha state statute.

The chair thanked everyone for their participation and input. No actions were taken at the end of the meeting due to the complex nature of the items discussed, but it was noted that further updates and discussions will likely occur in the coming weeks.
