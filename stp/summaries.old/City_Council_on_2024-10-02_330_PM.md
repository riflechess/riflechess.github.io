#### Meeting Info
Meeting Title: City Council on 2024-10-02 3:30 PM
Meeting Description: Live and Recorded Public meetings of City Council on 2024-10-02 3:30 PM for City of Saint Paul

#### Summary
The meeting started with the approval of the consent agenda, which included several resolutions, including declaring October as Domestic Violence Awareness Month. The council acknowledged the crucial services provided by St. Paul and Ramsey County Domestic Abuse Intervention Project (SPIP) to victims of domestic violence.

Next, the council discussed Resolution 24-1458, which declared October as Domestic Violence Awareness Month. The executive director of SPIP, Shelly Klein, accepted the resolution and shared some statistics about the organization's work. Council members praised SPIP for their dedication and tireless efforts in supporting families across the city.

The council then moved on to discuss Resolution 24-1403, which concerned a cigarette tobacco license held by Zachariah Abdukhidir. The Department of Safety and Inspection (DSI) requested that the council modify the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations made by the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). DSI believed that the ALJ did not give adequate weight to certain evidence, including testimony from Licensing Manager Eric Hudak.

The owner's attorney, Mark Thompson, argued against revoking the license, citing a lack of substantial and compelling reasons. He also mentioned that there were no aggravating factors present in this case, unlike in previous cases where revocation was considered.

After some discussion, the council decided to lay over Resolution 24-1403 for one week, allowing them to review the evidence and consider DSI's request.

The meeting then moved on to public hearings on various items. Item 20 was a rezoning application for Tech Holdings, LLC, which was approved with amendments. Items 21 through 26 were also approved, including resolutions related to sound level variances for Wabasha Brewing Company and Allianz Field.

Item 27 concerned the appeal of Donald A. Henridge to a notice of condemnation as unfit for human habitation. The council heard from Mr. Moorman that the condemnation was lifted, and the balance of the orders were converted to a simple correction order.

The meeting concluded with public hearings on items 28 through 46, which included legislative hearing consent agenda items. Item 37 concerned a vacant building registration fee at 1033 Maryland Avenue East, where Jovanna McCoy testified that she had recently experienced a fire and was struggling to pay the $2,500 fee. The council discussed possible paths forward, including denying the appeal and letting it go to assessment.

After some discussion, the council decided to adopt the recommendation of the legislative hearing officer, which would delay the vacant building registration fee for Jovanna McCoy's property.

Item 38 was a ratified special tax assessment for property at 1062 Minnehaha Avenue East. The owner, Darren Dallin, testified that he had already been billed for the work and questioned why it hadn't been completed yet. The council discussed the issue of liability and decided to adopt the recommendation of the legislative hearing officer.

The meeting concluded with a combined public hearing on items 28 through 46, which were adopted as amended.
