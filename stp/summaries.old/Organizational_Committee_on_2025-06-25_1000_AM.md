#### Summary
The meeting began with a presentation by the St. Paul Children's Collaborative, which serves as a family service collaborative in Ramsey County. The organization aims to improve outcomes for young people in St. Paul through grant-making, advocacy, program development, and convening. The committee discussed various youth outcome plan indicators, including kindergarten readiness, third-grade reading proficiency, health care coverage, connection to caring adults, child abuse and neglect, and high school graduation rates.

Some of the notable points from the discussion include:

* There are significant disparities in kindergarten readiness between white students and students of color.
* The data on third-grade reading proficiency shows a decline over the past few years, with 27% of St. Paul public schools meeting reading standards.
* Health care coverage is relatively low among children in St. Paul, especially since the Affordable Care Act was implemented.
* Connection to caring adults is an important indicator, and students from diverse backgrounds tend to report lower levels of support from adults in their family and community.

The discussion also touched on the importance of collecting data on specific racial and ethnic groups within the city's demographics. The committee noted that some charter schools may have a high percentage of non-St. Paul students, which can affect the data.

In addition to discussing the St. Paul Children's Collaborative, the meeting moved on to discuss potential topics for the Audit Committee to review. Two main options were presented: revisiting the housing development process and examining the city's data practices process. The committee ultimately decided to prioritize the data practices process, which has been raised as an issue by both city staff and external stakeholders.

Council Member Nacre mentioned that the St. Paul Children's Collaborative is partially funded by Ramsey County, Community Action Partnership of Ramsey and Washington County, St. Paul Public Schools, and the City of St. Paul. However, the city's contribution to the collaborative was vetoed by the administration last year, and it remains unpaid.

The meeting concluded with a discussion about the Audit Committee's next steps in reviewing the data practices process and revisiting the housing development process in conjunction with other ongoing studies.
