#### Highlights

**Lead Pipe Replacement Plan**
Water Services launched an ambitious 10-year plan to replace all lead pipes at no cost to property owners. While lead is not present in water leaving the treatment plant, it can get into drinking water from lead service lines and poses health risks.

**Skinner's Pub Sound Level Variance Debate**
The council approved a revised version of the sound level variance resolution for Skinner's Pub after discussions with the applicant and testifiers. The revised version includes compromises made to reduce the impact of amplified sound on nearby residents.

**Office of Neighborhood Safety Budget Controversy**
Council Member Johnson expressed concerns about the timing of a request to increase funding in the Office of Neighborhood Safety Special Fund, leading to a motion to lay over the resolution for further review at the June 5th meeting.
