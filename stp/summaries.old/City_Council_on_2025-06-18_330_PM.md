#### Summary

The City Council met on June 18th to discuss several items. Firstly, a public hearing was held regarding the creation of a Commercial Development District at 1624/1626 White Bear Avenue North. This proposal aims to allow businesses in this area to operate later into the night, specifically until 2 AM. However, concerns were raised by residents and business owners about noise levels and potential increased crime.

The council members acknowledged these concerns but also emphasized their commitment to supporting local businesses. They encouraged open communication between businesses and neighboring communities to address these issues. The public hearing was closed with a motion to lay over the item for final adoption on June 25th.

Additionally, the council passed several resolutions. One of them recognized Juneteenth as an annual celebration of Black Liberation in the city of St. Paul. They also honored and recognized the national holiday by highlighting the work of Nexus Community Partners, a non-profit organization that uplifts justice and transformation in the community.

Another resolution approved was related to the adverse action against Seven White Bears Liquor for failing to pass a youth compliance tobacco check. The licensee requested a waiver of the $500 penalty, citing their good standing as business owners with no prior issues.

The council also discussed an ordinance change that would allow the city to send bills instead of garbage haulers and adjust late fees for delinquent garbage bills.
