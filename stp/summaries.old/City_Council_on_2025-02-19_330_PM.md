Council Member Bowie honored Frank White for his outstanding contributions to African American history and culture in St. Paul. Mr. White's work has led to the creation of a resource that highlights African-American heritage in the city, including street names, parks, and schools named after notable figures.

The Council also discussed two zoning appeals related to Highland Bridge: ABZA 25-1 and ABZA 25-2. While there was a tie vote on both items, the motion to grant the appeal for ABZA 25-1 failed due to a lack of additional votes.
