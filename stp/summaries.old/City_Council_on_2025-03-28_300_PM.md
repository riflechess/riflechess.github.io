#### Summary

The City Council convened for a special meeting on March 28th to discuss and select an interim council member for Ward 4. However, the proceedings were marked by controversy and disagreement among council members. The initial plan was to withdraw the resolution and give the council more time to reach a consensus, but this plan was met with resistance.

Council President [Nacre] expressed frustration and disappointment with the actions taken at a previous meeting, which he felt did not meet the standards of fairness, openness, and transparency. He attributed the controversy to a surprise action taken by another council member while he was on bereavement leave. As a result, one of the candidates withdrew from the process.

The council struggled to agree on the sponsor of the resolution, with Council President [Nacre] initially claiming sponsorship before acknowledging that it remained in the original sponsor's name. The point of order and subsequent discussion only added to the tension, ultimately leading to the withdrawal of the resolution.
