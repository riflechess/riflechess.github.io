**Meeting Type:** City Council meeting
**Purpose:** Review of agenda items 1-21 and adoption of resolutions and ordinances
**Date/Time:** April 24, 2024, 3:30 PM

#### Summary
The city council meeting covered several key topics. The consent agenda was adopted with amendments, including the approval of a final plat for the United Village Development (item 12) and the closure of public hearings on items 17-21.

Resolution 24-578 was approved, allowing for the development to proceed as planned. This included the support of outgoing council members in setting preliminary plats and moving forward with the project.

The city council also adopted Resolution Public Hearing 24-76, updating the St. Paul Bicycle Plan as an addendum to the Comprehensive Plan. The plan includes over 100 new miles of future separated bikeways and anticipates funding from a voter-approved local sales tax.

Ordinance 24-10 was approved for final adoption, amending Chapter 293 to allow certain events to obtain one amplified sound permit for multiple days. This was the result of months of work by Councilwoman Nacre (misspelled as "Nacre" in the meeting notes) and department staff.

Public hearings were held on items 15 and 16, with no speakers opposing the rezoning of property at 892 East 7th Street and approval of a sound-level variance for an event at the Minnesota State Capitol. The consent agenda items 17-21 were also approved without opposition.

The council president announced that the bike plan would be available online soon, allowing residents to review the updated routes and infrastructure plans. Council members shared news from their wards, including an upcoming celebration of the Rondo Street name change on April 30th.
