However, he noted a significant deficiency related to suspension and debarment verification for federal program requirements.

In conclusion, the meeting aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the vacant building ordinance and program in Saint Paul. The presentation highlighted successes and challenges, as well as areas for refinement.
