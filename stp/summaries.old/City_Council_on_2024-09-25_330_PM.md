#### Meeting Info
**Meeting Title:** City Council on 2024-09-25 3:30 PM
**Meeting Description:** Live and Recorded Public meetings of City Council on 2024-09-25 3:30 PM for City of Saint Paul

#### Summary

The meeting began with the introduction of the council members and the approval of a liquor license application for GoPuff, Inc. at 129 State Street.

The council then discussed the housing redevelopment authority's maximum property levy for 2025, which was previously approved by the HRA but needed to be ratified by the city council. The council voted in favor of approving the maximum property tax levy for the HRA.

The next item on the agenda was the consideration of a 2025 maximum property tax levy for the city. Council member Bowie proposed increasing the levy from 7.9% to 8.1%, citing concerns about the regressive nature of property taxes and the need to prioritize funding for critical services, including reparations work.

The council had a lengthy discussion on this topic, with several members expressing support for the original proposal but also recognizing the importance of prioritizing community needs and finding ways to reduce costs. Ultimately, Council member Bowie withdrew her motion, and the council voted in favor of adopting the 7.9% levy limit.

The meeting then moved on to discuss zoning issues, including a rezoning application for 629 Bush Avenue that would allow for a light industrial use. The council approved this request and scheduled a public hearing for October 2nd.

The final item on the agenda was a discussion of fleet services, where the council voted to use fund balance to purchase new vehicles and equipment. This decision was made in response to a backlog of needed replacements due to inflation and supplier delays.
