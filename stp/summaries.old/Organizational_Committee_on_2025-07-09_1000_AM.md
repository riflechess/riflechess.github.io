Purpose: Bonding 101, Financial Overview of Debt Outstanding, and Discussion on Debt Limitations

#### Summary
The meeting covered various topics related to the city's debt, including bonding 101, financial overview of debt outstanding, and discussion on debt limitations. The committee reviewed a presentation by the city's treasurer, Sarah Brown, which included an overview of municipal bonds, general obligation bonds, revenue bonds, and notes.

Key decisions made during the meeting include:

* The city has a AAA credit rating from S&P and Fitch for its general obligation bonds.
* The city is considering increasing its debt service fund through property tax levy to reduce reliance on other revenue sources.
* The committee discussed the importance of maintaining a strong credit rating and the potential consequences of downgrading, including increased interest costs.

The meeting also touched on copper wire theft, an issue that has been affecting the city. Council members expressed concerns about the lack of transparency in the city's response to this issue and requested updates on the city's efforts to combat it.

Notable disagreements or areas of contention during the meeting included:

* The use of sales tax revenue to plug gaps in the debt service fund, which some committee members considered a non-ideal practice.
* The need for more transparency in the city's response to copper wire theft and the lack of clear information on the city's allocation for this issue.

The committee also discussed potential alternatives to copper wire, such as solar or aluminum.
