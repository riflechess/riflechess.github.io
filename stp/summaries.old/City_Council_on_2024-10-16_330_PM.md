#### Summary
The meeting began with a presentation by Director Andy Rodriguez of the St. Paul Parks and Recreation Department regarding a new co-management agreement between the City of St. Paul and Walk-On-Tipi Awenkapi to store the land at Bruce Vento Nature Sanctuary. The agreement will allow for traditional Indigenous land management methods to be implemented, reflecting years of intentional learning alongside Dakota leaders by city staff.

The Council then heard from Beth Comers and investigators from the Human Rights and Equal Economic Opportunity Department regarding a proposed wage theft ordinance. They presented data on the prevalence of wage theft in Minnesota and St. Paul, highlighting its impact on workers, particularly women, BIPOC, undocumented workers, and low-wage workers.

After the presentation, Council Members discussed the ordinance and expressed support for it. The Council voted to lay over the ordinance to October 23rd for a second reading public hearing.

The meeting also included a discussion regarding a property at 887 Charles Avenue, which was previously identified as needing rehabilitation or removal due to its condition. The owner had failed to provide a work plan and evidence of funding, leading to concerns about his ability to complete the project. Council Members debated whether to allow additional time for him to find a development partner or to move forward with demolition.

The meeting concluded with the adoption of the consent agenda, which included several legislative hearing items, and the adjournment of the meeting.
