#### Summary

The meeting focused on the discussion of a consistent budget-to-actual review and reporting practice between the Housing Redevelopment Authority (HRA) Board and Planning and Economic Development (PED) leadership and staff. Deputy Director Green presented an in-depth analysis of the Enforce system, which is used for accounting management, transaction processing, and financial reporting.

The group discussed various aspects of budget-to-actual review, including:

* The need for a consistent practice between HRA Board and PED leadership and staff
* Reviewing standard system reports available in the Enforce system
* Highlighting key specific line items and understanding their impact on budget variances
* Identifying areas where funding could be optimized or increased

Commissioner Nacer expressed concerns about programmatic budgeting versus accounting language budgeting, highlighting that many line items do not directly relate to programming. Director Newton explained the custom budget design in Infor and the need for additional information to make decisions.

The group also discussed potential changes to the budget-to-actual review process, including:

* Requesting an earlier report on year-to-date budget compared to year-to-date spent
* Considering a more comprehensive view of revenue and expenses
* Addressing accounting challenges, such as the distinction between account location and transaction processing

Commissioner Provatsky asked about internal pooled interest revenue, which Deputy Director Green explained was interest earned on cash balances in various funds.

The group also discussed upcoming federal budget changes, including proposed cuts to HUD funding and potential impacts on Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) programs. Commissioner Kim expressed concerns about shifting dollars away from CDBG without losing sight of equitable investment goals.

Council President Akers acknowledged the complexity of CDBG programs and the need for clearer guidance on indirect cost rates. The group also discussed HUD proposed rule changes, which could affect home investment partnership and emergency solutions grant programs.

The meeting concluded with an agreement to continue working together to improve budget-to-actual review practices and address challenges related to federal funding changes.
