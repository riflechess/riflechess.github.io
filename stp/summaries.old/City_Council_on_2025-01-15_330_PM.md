#### Summary

The meeting began with a roll call and approval of the consent agenda. The first item discussed was an ordinance (Ordinance 25-4) amending Title 4 of the Administrative Code to add Chapter 92 titled Tree Preservation for City-Sponsored Projects. This ordinance aims to preserve urban tree canopies by making sure that trees are preserved, replanted, or replaced in city right-of-way projects.

The council heard from Director Kershaw and discussed how the city plans to implement this policy. They also received public comments from community members, including some who expressed support for the ordinance and others who raised concerns about the cost of implementation and potential impacts on low-income communities.

The next item was a public hearing on Ordinance 25-2, which amends Chapter 6.03 of the city charter to allow administrative citations for violations of city ordinances. Community members testified in favor of the ordinance, sharing stories of experiences with predatory landlords and wage theft. They argued that administrative citations would provide a necessary tool for enforcing existing ordinances and protecting workers' rights.

Council Member Yang moved to delay voting on Ordinance 25-2 until January 22nd, citing concerns about equity and fairness. Council President Jalali responded by outlining the process for implementing the ordinance, including the need for an equity plan and community input. The council heard from other members, who expressed support for the ordinance and acknowledged the need for careful implementation.

The meeting also included a public hearing on Item 26, which involved rezoning property at 1655 and 1661 Grand Avenue and 37 Macalester Street from T2 traditional neighborhood to RM1 multiple family. The council voted to lay over this item until January 22nd.

In the afternoon, the council discussed several other items, including a public hearing on RLH RSA 24-12 (item 39), which involves an appeal of a rent stabilization determination at 1391 Hazelwood Street Apartments 10 and 11. The council heard from tenants who argued that the landlord's request for an 8% rent increase was unfair because it included a garage parking fee.

The council also discussed a public hearing on RLHRTA 24-386 (item 47), which involves ratifying a special tax assessment for property at 1066 Stinson Street. The owner of the house testified that he had been misinformed about what was required by the order to remove debris from his property and requested a reduction or deletion of the assessment.

Finally, the council voted on several other items, including Item 44, which involved ordering the raising and removal of structures at 1784 Norfolk Avenue. The council voted to adopt the recommendation of the legislative hearing officer to order the building removed within 15 days with no options for its rehabilitation.
